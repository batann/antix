   == What is I2P ==

   The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a decentralized anonymizing
   network built using [120]Java on similar principles to Tor, but which
   was designed from the ground up as a self-contained darknet.

   I2P is effectively an internet within an internet. Once connected you
   can send email, browse websites, use blogging and forum software, host
   websites, take advantage of decentralized file storage, engage in
   anonymous real-time chat, and much more. As noted, you can also surf
   the open web anonymously, but I2P is probably not the best tool for the
   job in this regard.


   == I2P Torrenting and I2P Snark ==

   I2P torrenting is becoming increasingly popular, and there is a torrent
   client exclusively designed for I2P. [121]I2PSnark is basically a
   torrent client for the I2P network that uses the BitTorrent protocol.
   It is also a torrent creator that delivers metainfo.torrent files
   equipped with an in-built tracker.

   We also must note that ProPrivacy does not in any way condone or
   encourage the downloading of copyrighted material. If you want more
   information about staying secure, check out our [122]best VPN for
   torrenting guide.


   == I2P Bote ==

   I2P has two main messaging services, one of them is I2P Bote. It’s a
   service for secure and anonymous messaging, therefore you are not able
   to send messages for the "visible” Internet. It automatically encrypts
   messages, and it is possible to have multiple email accounts with only
   one click. It is the most secure way for communication, and its
   popularity is on the rise.

== How To Use I2P? ==

   The official I2P website is very techie-orientated, and in our view it
   doesn't do a good job of explaining in simple, newbie-friendly terms.

   Therefore we composed a brief guide on how to use I2P, to get you up
   and running with the I2P Darknet in Windows (since that is the system
   we run). If security is a top priority for you, then you should not use
   Windows (or OSX), instead opting for a Linux distro (and preferably a
   security-oriented one such as Tails or Liberté Linux). Even better, use
    Ipredia OS, a Linux distro based on I2P, with websites and services
   only accessible through an I2P proxy tunnel.

== How To Set Up And Connect ==

    1. [123]Download and install Java – I2P is written in the Java
       programming language, so to run it you will need to have Java
       installed. It is quite likely that you already have this on your
       system, but if not, then download the latest version and install it
       (if you are not sure then skip this step for a minute, and come
       back if I2P refuses to run).
    2. [124]Download, install and run I2P.
    3. When you run I2P, a console window will open. If you need help,
       then you can copy and paste the log files from here, which will be
       useful to anyone assisting you.
       I2P Setup
    4. A browser window will also open on the I2P Router Console page to
       let you know that you have connected successfully to the IP2
       network. You may initially have to wait a few minutes while the
       software finds peers and connects tunnels to them.
       I2P Browser
    5. Once done, the Router Console will show that you are fully
       connected.

== I2P Browser ==

   In order to browse eepsites in the I2P network, your browser must be
   configured for that purpose. On the I2P website you can also find
   [125]a useful guide for the configuration settings of some popular
   browsers like Internet Explorer or Firefox.

   It can be done in any browser, but as we consider Internet Explorer to
   be insecure, and Chrome an open window for Google spying, we will use
   Firefox (the process is similar regardless of browser).
    1. Go to Firefox -> Options -> Advanced tab -> Network tab ->
       Connection Settings.
    2. Check the ‘Manual proxy configuration’ box and enter the following
       values: HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1, Port: 4444. It is also a good idea
       to add ‘localhost, 127.0.0.1 to the ‘No Proxy for’ box.
       Firefox Settings for I2P
    3. OK your way back out of Settings and you are done!
    4. It is commonly recommended that you use the Firefox Extension
       "FoxyProxy" to change proxy settings quickly if you use I2P often.
       That is a great idea, but we experienced connection problems when
       we tried it (which may be the fault of our highly kinked Firefox
       browser).
    5. You should now be able to connect to I2P websites, known as
       eepsites which have the .i2p suffix. Enter the address of any
       eepsite (one of the .i2p links in the Router Console window is a
       good place to start).
       I2P Websites
    6. At first, you will not have any eepsites in your router’s Address
       book so you will need the help of a ‘jump’ service. The reasons for
       this are somewhat technical, but all you need do is click one of
       the jump service links. If a link doesn’t work, try another (we had
       much better luck using the second link down).
       eepsite Addressbook
    7. Click on "Save [website] to router address book and continue to
       eepsite", and the eepsite should load. Unfortunately, when you
       first start using I2P, you may have to go through this process a
       few times.

== I2P Ready To Use ==

   You should now be connected to an eepsite, and are ready to explore the
   I2P darknet. A good place to start finding new eepsites is the
   eepsite.com search engine. Enjoy!

   A great deal of information (including info on configuring firewall
   ports) is available from the main website but is beyond the scope of
   this beginners guide. If you have further questions about I2P, what it
   is good for, and what alternatives are out there, then read on!

== Be secure on the dark web ==

   We recommend that you use a VPN service before downloading encrypted
   browsers I2P or Tor in order to cover your tracks. Find out more in our
   [126]best VPN for the dark web article.

== Tor ==

   Tor sits in a slightly odd position, as it was designed primarily to
   access the visible internet anonymously. That, however, is one of its
   primary weaknesses. There are a limited number of exit nodes, which
   makes it easy to block these exit nodes, to set up ‘honeypot’ exit
   nodes to monitor traffic (although the way in which the [127]onion
   router works should still ensure that the end user remains anonymous),
   and to perform [128]‘end-to-end-timing’ attacks to uncover the identity
   of Tor users.

   In response to this, Tor has developed its Hidden Services protocol,
   which allows Tor-only websites (.onion) and services to exist entirely
   within the Tor network so that users do not have to access the visible
   web through potentially dangerous exit nodes at all. Tor Hidden
   Services therefore also acts as a Dark Web and is by far the most
   popular such service.

   However, because Tor was not originally designed as a darknet,
   alternatives such as I2P and Freenet, which were created from the
   ground-up as darknets, offer distinct advantages.

VPN vs. Tor vs. I2P – Which one should you use?

   == VPN vs Tor vs I2P ==

   The simplest answer is that it depends on what you want to do.
   Fortunately, nothing is stopping you using all three depending on the
   task at hand, which is the approach we would advocate.

== VPN ==

   For general internet use, VPN is fast and easy to use, while providing
   a high degree of privacy. We firmly believe that people should VPN all
   the time by default to prevent dragnet surveillance by the likes of the
   NSA. It is also ideal for P2P downloading.

== Tor ==

   If you need to interact with the outside world as anonymously as
   possible then Tor cannot be beaten. For example, if you are a
   whistleblower and want to contact a journalist. You can add further
   layer of anonymity by connecting to Tor through a VPN service.

   Although Tor Hidden Services are not as secure or fast as I2P, their
   relative popularity can make them more fun and it may be important to
   website owners looking for visitors. It is also older, has more
   developers, and is better funded.

== I2P ==

   Technically it is the superior option if you want to access the Dark
   Web, and is our tool of choice for this. Although not as popular as Tor
   Hidden Services, it is still very sociable (and much more so than rival
   Freenet), and is an excellent choice for P2P downloading. Like Tor, it
   is a good free option for accessing the visible web anonymously for
   free (and maybe faster), but the limited number of outproxies mean that
   it is also much less anonymous when used in this way.

== VPN and Tor ==

   VPN and Tor are two ways to stay anonymous and preserve your privacy
   when online. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, which we discuss in
   some detail in this article. The bottom line is that Tor is extremely
   secure but very slow and unsuitable for P2P downloading, while VPN is
   less secure because it relies on trusting your VPN provider, but is
   much faster, is excellent for P2P downloading, and generally provides a
   better web browsing experience.

   What both these technologies have in common is that they are primarily
   concerned with accessing the publicly indexed ‘visible’ (or ‘surface’)
   web.

== I2P vs. Tor ==

   I2P vs Tor Mini Infographic
     * While Tor uses a centralized directory to manage the overall ‘view’
       of the network, as well as gather and report statistics, I2P uses a
       distributed peer-to-peer model
     * Unlike Tor Onion routing, I2P uses Garlic routing, which encrypts
       multiple messages together to make it more difficult for attackers
       to perform traffic analysis
     * In contrast with Tor, I2P tunnels are uni-directional, so incoming
       traffic and outgoing traffic are completely separate, which
       improves anonymity
     * I2P uses packet switching instead of Tor’s circuit switching, which
       means transparent load balancing of messages across multiple peers,
       rather than a single path. Essentially, all peers participate in
       routing for others
     * I2Ps uses its own API rather than SOCKS which is used by Tor. This
       helps to make I2P more secure than Tor.

   As with Tor, users of I2P connect to each other using peer-to-peer
   encrypted tunnels, but there are some fundamental technical
   differences.

   Just as Tor is primarily a tool designed to access the visible web
   anonymously, but which can be used as a darknet, I2P is a Dark Web tool
   that can also be used to access the surface web anonymously through
   Outproxies (which are equivalent to [129]Tor Exit Nodes). However, I2P
   Outproxies suffer similar weaknesses to Tor Exit Nodes, and the fact
   that there are far fewer of them (as I2P has a much smaller user base)
   means that they are potentially more open to attack.

== Using I2P Conclusion ==

   We hope that you have all the information and knowledge you need
   regarding I2P! One thing to note is, just as with VPN and Tor, I2P does
   not hide the fact that you are using the service, but does make it very
   hard to discover what you get up to when connected to it. The result is
   that if using hidden services, I2P is both much faster than using Tor
   (it was designed with P2P downloading in mind), more secure, and more
   robust.

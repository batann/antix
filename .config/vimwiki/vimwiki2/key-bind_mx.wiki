- Determin the key sequance:
	_You can determine the character sequence emitted by a key by pressing Ctrl-v at the command line, then pressing the key you're interested in. On my system for F12, I get ^[[24~. The ^[ represents Esc. Different types of terminals or terminal emulators can emit different codes for the same key._
	
	
	bind '"\e[24~":"foobar"'

	bind '"\e[24~":"pwd\n"'

	bind '"\e[24~":"\C-k \C-upwd\n"'

	"\e[24~":"\C-k \C-upwd\n"

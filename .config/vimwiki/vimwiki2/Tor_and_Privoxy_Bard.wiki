Installation:

Update repository lists: sudo apt update
Install Tor: sudo apt install tor
Install Privoxy: sudo apt install privoxy
Configuration:

Tor:

Edit Tor configuration file: sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
Uncomment the line #Uncomment the following to define an exit relay to use by default.
Choose a reliable exit node using Tor Project's website (<invalid URL removed>)
Add the chosen exit node after "ExitNodes {". Example: ExitNodes {relay1.exit-node.com:9030}
Save and close the file.
Privoxy:

Edit Privoxy configuration file: sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config
Find the line "listen -t 127.0.0.1:8118". This binds Privoxy to localhost port 8118.
Change it to "listen -t localhost:8118 # Tor" (with a # before the original line). This comments out the original binding and sets up a new one for Tor.
Find the line "forward localhost:9050". This directs Privoxy to Tor on port 9050.
Add a # before this line to comment it out.
Find the line "forward / localhost:9050 # Tor". This also directs Privoxy to Tor.
Uncomment this line.
Save and close the file.
Restart services:

Restart Tor: sudo systemctl restart tor
Restart Privoxy: sudo systemctl restart privoxy

<code>ls -1 | awk 'NR==1 {print} NR==2 || NR==4 {print ""} NR==3 {print}'</code>
Explanation:
============
ls -1: This lists the files in the current directory with one entry per line.
|: This pipe symbol sends the output of ls -1 (list of files) to the awk command.
awk 'NR==1 {print} NR==2 || NR==4 {print ""} NR==3 {print}': This is the awk command that processes the piped output. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
NR: This variable in awk refers to the current record number (line number) being processed.
NR==1 {print}: This part checks if the current line number is 1 (first line). If yes, it prints the line using the print statement. This will print the first file from the ls -1 output.
NR==2 || NR==4 {print ""}: This part checks if the current line number is either 2 or 4. If yes, it prints an empty line using print "". This creates the empty rows you want.
NR==3 {print}: This part checks if the current line number is 3 (third line). If yes, it prints the line using the print statement. This will print the second file from the ls -1 output.
Output:
=======
The command will display the list of files with empty lines in the second and fourth positions, effectively showing only the first and third files each on a separate line.
<code>ls -1 | awk '{printf("%-2s|%6s|%2s|%6s|\n", $0, "", $1, "")}'</code>
Explanation:
============
ls -1: This remains the same, listing files with one entry per line.
|: This pipe symbol continues to send the output to awk.
awk '{printf("%-2s|%6s|%2s|%6s|\n", $0, "", $1, "")}': This is the awk command with printf for formatted output. Here's a breakdown:
printf: This function allows formatted printing within awk.
"%-2s|%6s|%2s|%6s|\n": This is the format string for printf. It defines how the output will be structured:
%-2s: This prints the current line ($0) left-aligned within a width of 2 characters.
|: This prints a literal pipe symbol (|).
%6s: This prints 6 spaces.
|: This prints another literal pipe symbol (|).
%2s: This prints the first character of the current line ($1[0]) right-aligned within a width of 2 characters. (You can adjust this to %1s if you only want the first digit).
|: This prints another literal pipe symbol (|).
\n: This prints a newline character.
"": This is used twice to print empty strings within the format.
Output:
=======
	When <code>ls -1</code> yields the following output:
<code>10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80</code>
	This command will display the following:
<code>10|    |20|     |
30|    |40|     |
50|    |60|     |
70|    |80|     |</code>
	In order to limmit each row to 10 charachters each, minor adjustments
are required:
<code>ls -1 | awk '{printf("%-10s|%10s|%10s|%10s|\n", $0, "", $1, "")}'</code>

Explanation:
============
	The changes are minimal:
	%-10s: This modifies the width for the first field ($0) and filename printing to be 10 characters. It left-aligns the content within the 10-character space.
%10s: This modifies the width for the empty spaces and the first character printing to be 10 characters. This ensures consistent spacing and truncation if filenames exceed 10 characters.
	This command will display the following output:
<code>10          |          |20          |     |
30          |          |40          |     |
50          |          |60          |     |
70          |          |80          |     |</code>
	Now, each field is limited to a maximum of 10 characters. Filenames exceeding 10 characters will be truncated, and empty spaces will fill the remaining width.

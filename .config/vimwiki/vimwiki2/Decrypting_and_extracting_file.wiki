== Decrypting and extracting a file ==

If you want to extract the original file while decrypting it, strangely enough,
you issue the gpg command with no options.
`
$ ls`
cfile.txt.gpg
`$ gpg cfile.txt.gpg`
< Passphrase prompt >
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: AES encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
`$ ls`
cfile.txt  cfile.txt.gpg

You have restored your original file, and both the encrypted and decrypted
versions exist.

Wrap up

Of course, gpg has many more options than I've shown here. But these three are
easy-to-use encryption and decryption options that will get you started
protecting your files right away. I will demonstrate some of the other options
in a future article unless one of you wants to do that and submit it to Enable
Sysadmin for publication. Write the editorial team at
enable-sysadmin@redhat.com and tell us how you use the gpg command.

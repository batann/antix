Basic knowledge of Skyrim Alchemy Recipes is essential to surviving in a world
full of hostile dragons and otherworldly beings. Players who take the time to
learn this skill are often equipped to tackle any scenario the game throws at

== Key Takeaways ==

  • Alchemy in Skyrim lets you create different kinds of potions or poisons 
    which can be created by using ingredients gathered around the map.
  • Both potions and poisons act as buffs, potions enhance your abilities while
    poisons make your weapons better and give them effects.
  • There are a total of 25 different kinds of potions that you can craft.
  • The best potions that you can make are Fortify Enchanting, Restore Stamina,
    and Fortify Destruction.
  • Skyrim lets you craft a total of 20 different kinds of poisons.

We understand that it’s not really glamorous to invest points in a skill like
Alchemy, especially when others allow you to spew fire from your hands more
effectively. But what do you do when you’re backed into a corner with no
recovery items and no fortifying potions?

These situations are where players with a grasp of the Skyrim Alchemy Recipes
will truly shine. And with this guide, we’ll show you all of the items you can
craft with this skill.

== What Are Alchemy Ingredients In Skyrim? ==


Alchemy ingredients can be found all over the map of Skyrim. Some of these are
easy to find, while others are much rarer. If players don’t want to waste their
time searching for these ingredients, they can also purchase them from
Alchemists found in most major settlements in the game. If you’re short on
money, you can always create a bunch of gold with the Transmute Spell.

Each ingredient has four different effects, some of which are also shared by
other items. You can discover these either by brewing potions at an Alchemy Lab
using ingredients with the same effects or by eating the item directly from
your inventory to discover its first effect. Additional properties can be
discovered by investing points in the Experimenter perk in the Alchemy skill
tree.

We will now move on to the actual Skyrim Alchemy Recipes. These are divided
into two categories; Potions and Poisons.

To craft any of these, all you have to do is combine at least two of the
ingredients listed at an Alchemy Lab. It doesn’t matter what combination you
choose.

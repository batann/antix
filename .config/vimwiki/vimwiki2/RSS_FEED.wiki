==== What is RSS? ====

  • RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication
  • RSS allows you to syndicate your site content
  • RSS defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content
  • RSS files can be automatically updated
  • RSS allows personalized views for different sites
  • RSS is written in XML

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== Why use RSS? ====

RSS was designed to show selected data.

Without RSS, users will have to check your site daily for new updates. This may
be too time-consuming for many users. With an RSS feed (RSS is often called a
News feed or RSS feed) they can check your site faster using an RSS aggregator
(a site or program that gathers and sorts out RSS feeds).

Since RSS data is small and fast-loading, it can easily be used with services
like cell phones or PDA's.

Web-rings with similar information can easily share data on their web sites to
make them better and more useful.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== Who Should use RSS? ====

Webmasters who seldom update their web sites do not need RSS!

RSS is useful for web sites that are updated frequently, like:

  • News sites - Lists news with title, date and descriptions
  • Companies - Lists news and new products
  • Calendars - Lists upcoming events and important days
  • Site changes - Lists changed pages or new pages

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== Benefits of RSS ====
Here are some benefits of using RSS:

Choose your news
With RSS you can choose to view the news you want, the news that interest you
and are relevant to your work.

Remove unwanted information
With RSS you can (finally) separate wanted information from unwanted
information (spam)!

Increase your site traffic
With RSS you can create your own news channel, and publish it to the Internet!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== The History of RSS ====

  • 1997 - Dave Winer at UserLand develops scriptingNews. RSS was born
  • 1999 - Netscape develops RSS 0.90 (which supported scriptingNews)
  • 1999 - Dave Winer develops scriptingNews 2.0b1 (which included RSS 0.90
    features)
  • 1999 - Netscape develops RSS 0.91 (which included most features from
    scriptingNews 2.0b1)
  • 1999 - UserLand gets rid of scriptingNews and uses only RSS 0.91
  • 1999 - Netscape stops their RSS development
  • 2000 - UserLand releases the official RSS 0.91 specification
  • 2000 - O'Reilly develops RSS 1.0. This format uses RDF and namespaces.
  • 2000 - Dave Winer at UserLand develops RSS 0.92
  • 2002 - Dave Winer develops RSS 2.0 after leaving UserLand
  • 2003 - The official RSS 2.0 specification is released

RSS 1.0 is the only version that was developed using the W3C RDF (Resource
Description Framework) standard.

The idea behind RDF was to help create a Semantic Web. However, this does not
matter too much for ordinary users, but by using web standards it will be
easier for persons and applications to exchange data.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== What RSS Version Should I Use? ====

RSS 0.91 and RSS 2.0 are easier to understand than RSS 1.0. Our tutorial is
based on RSS 2.0.

The syntax rules of RSS 2.0 are very simple and very strict.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== Is RSS a Web Standard? ====

There is no official standard for RSS.

  • About 50 % of all RSS feeds use RSS 0.91
  • About 25 % use RSS 1.0
  • The last 25 % is split between RSS 0.9x versions and RSS 2.0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

==== How RSS Works ====

RSS is used to share content between websites.

With RSS, you register your content with companies called aggregators.

So, to be a part of it: First, create an RSS document and save it with an .xml
extension. Then, upload the file to your website. Next, register with an RSS
aggregator. Each day the aggregator searches the registered websites for RSS
documents, verifies the link, and displays information about the feed so
clients can link to documents that interests them.

Tip: Read our RSS Publishing chapter to view free RSS aggregation services.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== RSS Example ===

RSS documents use a self-describing and simple syntax.

Here is a simple RSS document:
<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">

<channel>
  <title>W3Schools Home Page</title>
  <link>https://www.w3schools.com</link>
  <description>Free web building tutorials</description>
  <item>
    <title>RSS Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp</link>
    <description>New RSS tutorial on W3Schools</description>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>XML Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://www.w3schools.com/xml</link>
    <description>New XML tutorial on W3Schools</description>
  </item>
</channel>

</rss>
</code>

 === Explanation ===
The first line in the document - the XML declaration - defines the XML version
and the character encoding used in the document. In this case the document
conforms to the 1.0 specification of XML and uses the UTF-8 character set.

The next line is the RSS declaration which identifies that this is an RSS
document (in this case, RSS version 2.0).

The next line contains the <channel> element. This element is used to describe
the RSS feed.

== The <channel> element has three required child elements: ==

  • <title> - Defines the title of the channel (e.g. W3Schools Home Page)
  • <link> - Defines the hyperlink to the channel (e.g. https://
    www.w3schools.com)
  • <description> - Describes the channel (e.g. Free web building tutorials)

Each <channel> element can have one or more <item> elements.

Each <item> element defines an article or "story" in the RSS feed.

The <item> element has three required child elements:

  • <title> - Defines the title of the item (e.g. RSS Tutorial)
  • <link> - Defines the hyperlink to the item (e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/
    xml/xml_rss.asp)
  • <description> - Describes the item (e.g. New RSS tutorial on W3Schools)

Finally, the two last lines close the <channel> and <rss> elements.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== Comments in RSS ===

The syntax for writing comments in RSS is similar to that of HTML:

<!-- This is an RSS comment -->
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RSS is Written in XML

Because RSS is XML, keep in mind that:

  • All elements must have a closing tag
  • Elements are case sensitive
  • Elements must be properly nested
  • Attribute values must always be quoted

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The RSS <channel> Element ==

The RSS <channel> element describes the RSS feed.

Look at the following RSS document:
<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">

<channel>
  <title>W3Schools Home Page</title>
  <link>https://www.w3schools.com</link>
  <description>Free web building tutorials</description>
  <item>
    <title>RSS Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp</link>
    <description>New RSS tutorial on W3Schools</description>
  </item>
</channel>

</rss>
</code>
As mentioned before, the <channel> element describes the RSS feed, and has
three required child elements:

  • <title> - Defines the title of the channel (e.g. W3Schools Home Page)
  • <link> - Defines the hyperlink to the channel (e.g. https://
    www.w3schools.com)
  • <description> - Describes the channel (e.g. Free web building tutorials)

The <channel> element usually contains one or more <item> elements. Each <item>
element defines an article or "story" in the RSS feed.

Furthermore, there are several optional child elements of <channel>. We will
explain the most important ones below.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The <category> Element ==

The <category> child element is used to specify a category for your feed.

The <category> element makes it possible for RSS aggregators to group sites

</image>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The <language> Element ==

The <language> child element is used to specify the language used to write your
document.

The <language> element makes it possible for RSS aggregators to group sites
based on language.

The language for the RSS document above could be:

<language>en-us</language>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The <item> Element ==

Each <item> element defines an article or "story" in an RSS feed.

Look at the following RSS document:
<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">

<channel>
  <title>W3Schools Home Page</title>
  <link>https://www.w3schools.com</link>

    xml/xml_rss.asp)
  • <description> - Describes the item (e.g. New RSS tutorial on W3Schools)

Furthermore, there are several optional child elements of <item>. We will
explain the most important ones below.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The <author> Element ==

The <author> child element is used to specify the e-mail address of the author
of an item.

Note: To prevent spam e-mails, some developers do not include the <author>
element.

The author of the item in the RSS document above could be:

<author>hege@refsnesdata.no</author>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

== The <comments> Element ==

The <comments> child element allows an item to link to comments about that
item.

A comment of the item in the RSS document above could be:

  • type - Defines the type of media file

A media-file included in the item in the RSS document above could be:

<enclosure url="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/rss.mp3"
length="5000" type="audio/mpeg" />
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

= Get Your RSS Feed Up On The Web =

Having an RSS document is not useful if other people cannot reach it.

Now it's time to get your RSS file up on the web. Here are the steps:

1. Name your RSS file. Notice that the file must have an .xml extension.

2. Validate your RSS file

3. Upload the RSS file to your web directory on your web server.

4. Copy the little orange RSS Logo or XML Logo button to your web directory.

5. Put the little orange "RSS" or "XML" button on the page where you will offer
RSS to the world (e.g. on your home page). Then add a link to the button that
links to the RSS file. The code will look something like this:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/myfirstrss.xml">
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/pic_rss.gif" width="36" height="14">
</a>.

6. Submit your RSS feed to the RSS Feed Directories (you can Google or Yahoo
for "RSS Feed Directories"). Note! The URL to your feed is not your home page,
it is the URL to your feed, like "https://www.w3schools.com/xml/
myfirstrss.xml".

7. Register your feed with the major search engines:

  • Google - http://www.google.com/submityourcontent/website-owner

8. Update your feed - After registering your RSS feed, you must make sure that
you update your content frequently and that your RSS feed is constantly
available.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== Can I Manage my RSS Feed Myself? ===

The best way to ensure your RSS feed works the way you want, is to manage it
yourself.

However, this can be very time consuming, especially for pages with lot of
updates.

An alternative is to use a third-party automated RSS.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== Automated RSS ===

For users who only need an RSS feed for their personal website, some of the
most popular blog (Web Log) managers that offer built-in RSS services are:

  • Wordpress
  • Blogger
  • Radio

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== RSS Readers ===

An RSS Reader is used to read RSS Feeds!

RSS readers are available for many different devices and OS.

There are a lot of different RSS readers. Some work as web services, and some
are limited to windows (or Mac, PDA or UNIX):

  • QuiteRSS - An open-source, cross-platform RSS/Atom news feed reader
  • FeedReader - A simple, straightforward feed reader that easily handles
    large number of feeds

Tip: Most browsers have a built-in RSS Reader. If you go to a web site that
offers RSS feeds, you will see an RSS icon RSS in the address bar, or toolbar.
Click on the icon to view a list of the different feeds. Choose the feed you
want to read.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

=== I have an RSS Reader. Now what? ===

Click on the little RSS Logo or XML Logo button next to the RSS feed you want
to read. Copy The URL you get in the browser window and paste it in your RSS
reader.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

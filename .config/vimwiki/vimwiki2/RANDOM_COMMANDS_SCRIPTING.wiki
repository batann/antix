	- replace from starting rs up to a space by an empty string, so that the rsXXX gets removed.
<code>sed 's/^rs[^ ]*//' file</code>
	- This supposed your rs was in the beginning of the line. If rs can appear anywhere in the file, use:
<code>sed 's/\brs[^ ]*//' file</code>








# Get the directory of the script
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"
# Now SCRIPT_DIR variable holds the directory path of the script
echo "The script is executing from: $SCRIPT_DIR"

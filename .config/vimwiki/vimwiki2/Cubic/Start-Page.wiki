On the Cubic Start Page, select a directory for your customization project.

Each Cubic project must have its own project directory.

Create a new folder for your project using the file chooser dialog, if needed.

Ensure that the directory you select is on a partition that supports Linux file names.

Directories on NTFS or FAT partitions or mounted remote directories can not be selected.

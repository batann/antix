Since Cubic is a graphical user interface application, this is the preferred way to launch Cubic.

## Command Line
Cubic can also be started by using the command-line.

    cubic [-h] [-l] [-v] [-V] [directory] [iso]

The `cubic` command accepts two optional positional arguments:

- `directory`

    The directory for a new or existing project. For a new project, the directory should be empty.

- `iso`

    The original ISO file for a new project. If `directory` is an existing project, this argument will be ignored.

The `cubic` command accepts four optional arguments:

- `-h, --help`

    Shows the help message and exits.

- `-l, --log`

    Outputs a formatted log to the project directory.

    (The log does not include Cubic startup information because a project directory must be selected first. To view Cubic startup information use `-v` or `--verbose` to show output on the console.)

- `-v, --verbose`

    Outputs a formatted log to the console. The log is 80 columns wide and can be useful for debugging.

- `-V, --version`

    Prints the Cubic version, author, and website, and exits.

Cubic may not be run using `sudo` or as `root` because it is graphical user interface application.

Click the Test button to test the generated ISO. The QEMU † emulator will launch and boot into the new ISO. If you do not have enough memory to permit testing, you will not see the Test button.

Click the Back button to make changes and generate a new ISO file.

Clicking the folder icon next to the custom disk file name opens a file browser displaying this file. Clicking the folder icon next to the checksum file name opens a file browser displaying this file.

If you want to delete all project working files (in order to save disk space) check the "Delete all project files..." checkbox. Although the generated *.iso file and corresponding *.md5 checksum file will not be deleted, you will not be able to continue customizing this project in the future.

However, if you chose to keep all project files, you will be able to continue customizing your project in the future.

Click the Close button to exit Cubic.

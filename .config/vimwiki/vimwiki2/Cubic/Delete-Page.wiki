The Cubic Delete Page shows the current project. Clicking the Delete button will delete all project files, and this action can not be undone. You can view all project files by clicking on the folder icon next to the project directory field. You can also open the folder containing your customized ISO (if it has already been generated). You can manually move this file and the corresponding checksum (*.md5) file out of the project directory. Alternatively, to keep any custom disk images and checksum files that are in the project directory, unselect the check box at the bottom of this page. This page will automatically transition to the next page when it is done.

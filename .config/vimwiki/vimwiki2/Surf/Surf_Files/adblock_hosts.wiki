Adblocking using /etc/hosts

   Adblocking is a non-trivial task, but there are trivial solutions.

host-gen

   Install hosts-gen from [38]http://git.r-36.net/hosts-gen/
% git clone git://git.r-36.net/hosts-gen
% cd hosts-gen
% sudo make install

   Make sure all your custom configuration from your current /etc/hosts is
   preserved in a file in /etc/hosts.d. The files have to begin with a
   number, a minus and then the name.

   Install the gethostszero script.`
# In the above directory.
% sudo cp examples/gethostszero /bin
% sudo chmod 775 /bin/gethostszero
% sudo /bin/gethostszero
% sudo hosts-gen
`
   Now the /etc/hosts with the zero hosts is ready and will be used in any
   further started application.

   The gethostszero file can of course be reused to more easier create the
   /etc/hosts file. A cronjob can be used to update the file and run
   hosts-gen again.

zerohosts

   The following script gather well-known and trusted lists from various
   places : [39]adaway, [40]someonewhocares, [41]pgl.yoyo...

   They are written in /etc/hosts file to disable DNS resolution.

   Get the script in an archive from here : [42]zerohosts.tgz.

   Include your own /etc/hosts rules by including a file as an argument
zerohosts /etc/myhosts.txt

   Run the script each time you want to update the lists using a cronjob,
   or /etc/rc.local :
/usr/local/sbin/zerohosts &

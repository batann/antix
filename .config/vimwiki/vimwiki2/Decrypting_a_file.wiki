=== Decrypting a file ===

Decrypting a file means that you remove the encryption to read the file's
contents. There's no extraction of content or creation of the original file
when you decrypt.

`$ cat cfile.txt`

This is an encryption and decryption test

`$ gpg -c cfile.txt`

< Set passphrase and repeat passphrase >

`$ ls`

`$ cfile.txt cfile.txt.gpg`
`
$ rm cfile.txt`


`$ gpg -d cfile.txt.gpg`
gpg: AES encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
This is an encryption and decryption test

`$ ls`
cfile.txt.gpg

`$ cat cfile.txt.gpg`

Note that there was no passphrase prompt to decrypt the file. If you want to be
prompted to enter the password to decrypt the file again, you'll have to wait
ten minutes, which is the default timeout value.

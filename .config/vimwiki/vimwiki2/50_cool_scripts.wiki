Hey there! So, you’ve heard of Bash before, right? It’s like the “cool kid” of the command-line world, somewhat akin to the Windows Command Prompt (CMD), but with a twist. If you’re nodding along but haven’t really delved into it, you’re in for a treat!

Think of Bash as your trusty sidekick for navigating and controlling your computer via text commands. It’s used by virtually every major tech company and system developers worldwide. You see, the magic of Bash lies in its simplicity and efficiency. With just a few well-placed keystrokes, you can zip through tasks, manage files, and automate processes much faster than clicking around with a mouse and a graphical user interface (GUI).

Even if you’re on a Windows machine, fear not! You can tap into the power of Bash through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and suddenly, you’ll find yourself effortlessly conquering tasks that used to feel daunting. So, if you’ve been hesitating, it’s time to dive in and discover how Bash can supercharge your computing experience. Trust me, it’s worth it!

That said, Here’s a list of 50 common Bash scripts along with explanations of their use that you could try since we learn by doing:

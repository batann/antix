  # This is a comment
  # The NixOS configuration file is a Nix expression
  # It describes the desired state of the system

  # The top-level attribute is the system configuration
  # It defines the packages, services, and other settings

  # The system configuration is a function that takes an argument
  # The argument is a set of options that can be customized

  # Here is an example of a basic NixOS configuration

  # Import the NixOS options
  imports = [
    <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/installer/scan/not-detected.nix>
    <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix>
  ];

  # Define the system configuration
  # The argument is a set of options
  # The options can be customized to modify the system configuration
  # In this example, we are using the default options
  # The default options are defined in the imported modules
  # The options can be overridden or extended as needed
  # The result of the function is the system configuration
  # It is a set of attributes that define the desired state of the system
  # The attributes can include packages, services, and other settings
  # In this example, we are not customizing the system configuration
  # We are using the default options provided by the imported modules
  # The result is a basic NixOS configuration

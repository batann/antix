== Example Usage ==
To create a simple horizontal and vertical split setup and send a command to a specific pane, you can do the following:
=== Split horizontally: ===
	kitty @ launch --type=horizontal
=== Split vertically in the new pane: ===
	kitty @ launch --type=vertical
=== Send text to the second pane: ===
	kitty @ send-text --match cmdline:my-command 'ls\n'
These commands can be used in scripts or directly from the command line to manage Kitty panes efficiently.

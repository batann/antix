Claudia Breger. THE LEADER’S TWO BODIES: SLAVOJ ZIZEK’S POSTMODERN
    POLITICAL THEOLOGY. Diacritics 31.1 (2001): 73-90.

The first problem I have is: to what should I effectively respond? I find it difficult to
recognize the theory I developed in the text, so often is my position distorted by means
of an entire bag of rhetorical tricks:

     —thoroughly distorting paraphrases of my line of argumentation (for example,
“Thus, resistance to the ‘formal’ law of Judaism works as the enactment of the divine
Law constituted by the ‘real’ content of Christianity” [85]—where do I speak of the
“divine Law constituted by the ‘real’ content of Christianity”?), up to simple inventions
inserted to render the critique more piquant by making me appear antifeminist, and so
forth (for example, “At the same time, ‘woman’s’ ‘naked’ body functions as a spectacle
doubtlessly deserving the philosopher’s lust” [88]—where do I claim anything resem-
bling this?).

     —the artifice of rendering my position in a falsified way, which makes it an easy
target of criticism, and then dismissing the fact that this is NOT my position either as
secondary attempts to answer (Judith Butler’s) criticism or as its inconsistency. Perhaps
the best example of this procedure is the short footnote 9:
                                          ∨ ∨
    As a response to Butler’s criticism, Zizek stresses today that this Real is none-
    theless “a symbolic determination” [FA 121], but he keeps insisting on its
    (retroactively
               ∨ ∨
                   installed) foundational status as a traumatic∨ “ahistorical” ker-
    nel [112; Zizek’s quotation marks]. [78, my emphasis—SZ]

Unfortunately, the features that I allegedly stress as a response to Butler’s criticism (the
Real, far from being a substantial starting point and reference/guarantee, emerges as the
retroactive effect of the failure of the symbolic process itself, and so forth) are system-
atically developed in my Sublime Object of Ideology, which, published in 1989, pre-
cedes Butler’s criticism [see 169–73]. (Incidentally, Butler herself accuses me of incon-
sistency when I characterize the Capital as the Real of our epoch, claiming that I thereby
contradict my own definition of the Real—surely the easiest way to avoid confronting
the inadequacy of her own notion of the Real: “I claim the notion of the Real in the
criticized author means X—the criticized author says things that do not fit X—no prob-
lem, it is not my notion that is wrong, he is inconsistent with himself . . .”).

    —finally, attributions of theoretical propositions that directly contradict my theses:




diacritics / spring 2001                              diacritics 31.1: 91–104            91
for example, the claim that my “epistemology collapses historical difference, and the
contemporary leader is modeled on the image of the ‘premodern’ king” [82]. Really?
Do I not, again, already in Sublime Object of Ideology, develop in detail the difference
between the traditional Master and the modern Leader [see 145–47]? Furthermore, when
my critic comments on the thesis that “the emperor cannot simply be undressed,” she
again imputes the very opposite of what I claim: the undressing of the king does not
work not because his charisma is indestructible, but because it only destroys his per-
sonal charisma, not the power of the symbolic place of the King—when we undress him,
we realize that “he is not truly a king” . . . and engage in the search for a true one.
(Incidentally, Marx makes a homologous point apropos of commodity fetishism: in or-
der to escape its grasp, it is not enough to realize that “commodity is just an object like
all others.”)

Once we discard these distortions, my critic’s basic line of argumentation is simple and
clear enough: my theory “does not allow for more optimistic scenarios of democratiza-
tion and the diminution of nationalism in society” [73], that is, I “outline a world eter-
nally ruled by a monstrous, earthbound Lord, a world not     ∨ ∨
                                                                 open to human agency and
political change. Because the authoritarian shape of his [Zizek’s] vision is constitutively
tied up with anti-Semitic and antifeminist phantasms, it is especially problematic” [75].
We are thus back to the old criticism elaborated by Butler, according to which the Real
I evoke “remains . . . grounding a realm beyond discourse” [78]: the real kernel, that
which is “in X more than X,” more than a combination of contingent symbolic determi-
nations and, as such, exempted from any transformative grasp of a human agency. Al-
though fantasmatic, this Real is irreducible, unshakable, charismatic, a traumatic point
of reference that assumes in my work different forms (king, woman, Jew, capital). In
sexual economy, this gives us Woman as Real, the ahistoric traumatic Thing; in racism,
this gives us the (anti-Semitic figure of the) Jew as the traumatic point of reference of
the racial imaginary; in politics proper, this gives us the King as the excess of the Real
which limits the open process of democratic reinscriptions and redefinitions. . . . Again,
the trouble with this line of criticism is that I find it difficult to recognize in the criti-
cized position my own theory, in which I repeatedly claim that symbolic practice can
transform the Real:

     Precisely because of this internality of the Real to the Symbolic, it is possible
     to touch the Real through the Symbolic—that is the whole point of Lacan’s
     notion of psychoanalytic treatment; this is what the Lacanian notion of the
     psychoanalytic act is about—the act as a gesture which, by definition, touches
     the dimension of some impossible Real. [“Class Struggle” 121]

And, as if answering in advance my critic’s claim that my world is “eternally ruled by a
monstrous, earthbound Lord” and, as such, not “open to human agency and political
change,” I emphasize that

     [a]n act does not merely redraw the contours of our public symbolic identity, it
     also transforms the spectral dimension that sustains this identity, the undead
     ghosts that haunt the living subject, the secret history of traumatic fantasies
     transmitted “between the lines,” through the lacks and distortions of the ex-
     plicit symbolic texture of his or her identity. [“Class Struggle” 124]

Is it possible to put it in clearer terms? An act intervenes in and changes precisely that
which, according to my critic, I elevate into a firm ground outside the scope of human




92

agency, the fantasmatic-real support of the symbolic process. So my proposal to the
reader of these lines is the following one: she should read the last paragraph of my
critic’s essay, and then read these lines from my contribution to Contingency, Hege-
mony, Universality:

     In what, then, does our difference consist? Let me approach this key point via
     another key criticism from Butler: her point that I describe only the paradoxi-
     cal mechanisms of ideology, the way an ideological edifice reproduces itself
     (the reversal that characterizes the effect of point de capiton, the “inherent
     transgression,” etc.), without elaborating how one can “disturb” (resignify,
     displace, turn against themselves) these mechanisms; I show:

         how power compels us to consent to that which constrains us, and
         how our very sense of freedom or resistance can be the dissimulated
         instrument of dominance. But what remains less clear to me is how
         one moves beyond such a dialectical reversal or impasse to some-
         thing new. How would the new be produced from an analysis of the
         social field that remains restricted to inversions, aporias, and rever-
         sals that work regardless of time and place? (JB, p. 29)

     In The Psychic Life of Power, Butler makes the same point apropos of Lacan
     himself:

         The [Lacanian] imaginary [resistance] thwarts the efficacy of the sym-
         bolic law but cannot turn back upon the law, demanding or effecting
         its reformulation. In this sense, psychic resistance thwarts the law in
         its effects, but cannot redirect the law or its effects. Resistance is thus
         located in a domain that is virtually powerless to alter the law that it
         opposes. Hence, psychic resistance presumes the continuation of the
         law in its anterior, symbolic form and, in that sense, contributes to its
         status quo. In such a view, resistance appears doomed to perpetual
         defeat.
             In contrast, Foucault formulates resistance as an effect of the very
         power that it is said to oppose. [. . .] For Foucault, the symbolic pro-
         duces the possibility of its own subversions, and these subversions
         are unanticipated effects of symbolic interpellations. [98–99]

     My response to this is triple. First, on the level of exegesis, Foucault is much
     more ambivalent on this point: his thesis on the immanence of resistance to
     power can also be read as asserting that every resistance is caught in advance
     in the game of the power it opposes. Second, my notion of “inherent transgres-
     sion,” far from playing another variation on this theme (resistance reproduces
     that to which it resists), makes the power edifice even more vulnerable: inso-
     far as power relies on its “inherent transgression,” then—sometimes, at least—
     overidentifying with the explicit power discourse—ignoring this inherent ob-
     scene underside and simply taking the power discourse at its (public) word,
     acting as if it really means what it explicitly says (and promises)—can be the
     most effective way of disturbing its smooth functioning. Third, and most im-
     portant: far from constraining the subject to a resistance doomed to perpetual
     defeat, Lacan allows for a much more radical subjective intervention than
     Butler: what the Lacanian notion of “act” aims at is not a mere displacement/




94
    resignification of the symbolic coordinates that confer on the subject his or
    her identity, but the radical transformation of the very universal structuring
    “principle” of the existing symbolic order. Or—to put it in more psychoana-
    lytic terms—the Lacanian act, in its dimension of “traversing the fundamental
    fantasy” aims radically to disturb the very “passionate attachment” that forms,
    for Butler, the ultimately ineluctable background of the process of
    resignification. So, far from being more “radical” in the sense of thorough
    historicization, Butler is in fact very close to the Lacan of the early 1950s, who
    found his ultimate expression in the rapport de Rome on “The Function and
    the Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis” (1953)—to the Lacan
    of the permanent process of retroactive historicization or resymbolization of
    social reality, to the Lacan who emphasized again and again how there is no
    directly accessible “raw” reality, how what we perceive as “reality” is
    overdetermined by the symbolic texture within which it appears.
          Along these lines, Lacan triumphantly rewrites the Freudian “stages” (oral,
    anal, phallic . . .) not as biologically determined stages in libidinal evolution,
    but as different modes of the dialectical subjectivization of the child’s position
    within the network of his or her family: what matters in, say, the anal stage is
    not the function of defecation as such, but the subjective stance it involves
    (complying with the Other’s demand to do it in an orderly way, asserting one’s
    defiance and/or self-control . . .). What is crucial here is that it is this Lacan of
    radical and unlimited resignification who is at the same time the Lacan of the
    paternal Law (Name-of-the-Father) as the unquestionable horizon of the
    subject’s integration into the symbolic order. Consequently, the shift from this
    early “Lacan of unlimited resignification” to the later “Lacan of the Real” is
    not the shift from the unconstrained play of resignification towards the asser-
    tion of some ahistorical limit of the process of symbolization: it is the very
    focus on the notion of Real as impossible that reveals the ultimate contin-
    gency, fragility (and thus changeability) of every symbolic constellation that
    pretends to serve as the a priori horizon of the process of symbolization.
          No wonder Lacan’s shift of focus towards the Real is strictly correlative to
    the devaluation of the paternal function (and of the central place of the Oedi-
    pus complex itself)—to the introduction of the notion that paternal authority is
    ultimately an imposture, one among the possible “sinthoms,” which allow us
    temporarily to stabilize and coordinate the inconsistent/nonexistent “big Other.”
    So Lacan’s point in unearthing the “ahistorical” limit of historicization/
    resignification is thus not that we have to accept this limit in a resigned way,
    but that every historical figuration of this limit is itself contingent and, as
    such, susceptible to a radical overhaul. So my basic answer to Butler—no
    doubt paradoxical for those who have been fully involved in recent debates—
    is that, with all the talk about Lacan’s clinging to an ahistorical bar, and so on,
    it is Butler herself who, on a more radical level, is not historicist enough: it is
    Butler who limits the subject’s intervention to multiple resignifications/dis-
    placements of the basic “passionate attachment,” which therefore persists as
    the very limit/condition of subjectivity. Consequently, I am tempted to supple-
    ment Butler’s series in her rhetorical question quoted above: “How would the
    new be produced from an analysis of the social field that remains restricted to
    inversions, aporias, reversals, and performative displacements or
    resignifications . . . ?” [“Da Capo senza Fine” 219–21]

Enough of self-quoting, since, I hope, I have made my point: after reading these lines




diacritics / spring 2001                                                                    95
(and my critic has read them, since she often quotes from the book from which they are
taken), in which I denounce symbolic authority as an imposture, in which I directly and
emphatically state that one can undermine unconscious fantasies, how can someone
write that I claim the exact opposite?
      How, then? I think the answer is double. First, what is the level my critic finds
problematic in my work—the level of traumatic fantasies which persist and insist be-
neath the multitude of symbolic games, thwarting our acts, dominating us behind our
backs, sabotaging our “resignifications”—if not the Freudian unconscious? Let us make
the point clear: what lurks in the position of my critic is simply the disavowal of psycho-
analysis. In the field from which she speaks, there is no place for the Freudian uncon-
scious—it is as simple as that.
      The second answer is best approached by way of quoting       the very last sentence of
                                                                 ∨ ∨
my critic’s essay: “Thus, we might want to reconsider his [Zizek’s] royal status in the
realm of theory” [88]. The ridicule of this statement cannot but strike the eye: here we
have a critic who speaks on behalf of (“we”) one of the hegemonic trends of today’s
academia, denouncing as racist/anti-Semitic/authoritarian, and so on, a Lacanian ap-
proach that is quite marginalized, almost completely powerless from the standpoint of
the distribution of power in Anglo-Saxon academia (one can count Lacanians in the US
universities on the fingers of two hands—not even one department is dominated by
them—and in Germany the situation is, if anything, even worse). This, then, is the level
on which things “really happen”: politics in the academic Ideological State Appara-
tuses. The unpleasant fact is that the position of my critics is far from marginal or re-
pressed—it is not the Antigonian voice of those who are excluded from the academic
public space, who live in the shadows of this space, but the voice of those who dominate
this space. To proclaim that I possess any kind of “royal status in the realm of theory”
from which I should be deposed is a cruel mockery of those who effectively occupy this
status. It is not I who am to be deposed; it is they who fear their own deposition. How-
ever, in order not to end in this purely polemical mood, let me conclude with a clarifica-
tion concerning three features of my work that appear most problematic to my critic:
my problematizing of democracy; the notion of the Real; my reference to Christianity.
      Today, when everyone is “anticapitalist”—even Hollywood “sociocritical” con-
spiracy movies (from The Pelican Brief to The Insider) in which the enemies are big
corporations with their ruthless pursuit of profit—the signifier “anticapitalism” has lost
its subversive sting. What one should problematize is rather the self-evident opposite of
this “anticapitalism”: trust that the democratic substance of honest Americans is able to
break up the conspiracy. This is the hard kernel of today’s global capitalist universe, its
true Master-Signifier: democracy.
      The limit of democracy is the State: in the democratic electoral process, the social
body is symbolically dissolved, reduced to a pure numerical multitude. The electoral
body is precisely not a body, a structured whole, but a formless abstract multitude, a
multitude without a State (in both Badiouian senses of this term: the state as the re-
presented unity of the multitude, and the State with its apparatuses). The point is thus
not that democracy is inherent to the State, sustained by its apparatuses, but that it
structurally ignores this dependency. When Alain Badiou says that the State is always in
excess with regard to the multitude it represents, this means that it is precisely this
excess which is structurally overlooked by democracy: the illusion is that the demo-
cratic process can control this excess of the State [Badiou 37].
      Which is why the antiglobalization movement is not enough: at some point, one
will have to problematize the self-evident reference to “freedom and democracy.” Therein
resides the ultimate “Leninist” lesson for today: paradoxically, it is only in this way, by
problematizing democracy—by making it clear how liberal democracy a priori, in its




96
very notion (as Hegel would have put it), cannot survive without capitalist private prop-
erty—that we can become effectively anticapitalist. Did the disintegration of Commu-
nism in 1990 not provide ultimate confirmation of the most “vulgar” Marxist thesis that
the actual economic base of political democracy is the private ownership of the means
of production, that is, capitalism with its class distinctions? The big urge after the intro-
duction of political democracy was “privatization,” the frantic effort to find—at any
price, in whatever way—new owners, who can be the descendants of the old owners
whose property was nationalized when the Communists took power, ex-Communist
apparatchiks, mafiosi . . . whoever, simply in order to establish a “base” of democracy.
The ultimate tragic irony is that this is all taking place too late—at exactly the moment
when, in First World “postindustrial” societies, private ownership has begun to lose its
central regulating role.
      The battle to be fought is thus twofold: first, yes, anticapitalism. However, anti-
capitalism without problematizing capitalism’s political form (liberal parliamentary
democracy) is not sufficient, no matter how “radical” it is. Perhaps the lure today is the
belief that one can undermine capitalism without effectively problematizing the liberal-
democratic legacy which—as some Leftists claim—although engendered by capital-
ism, has acquired autonomy and can serve to criticize capitalism. This lure is strictly
correlative to its apparent opposite, to the pseudo-Deleuzian love-hate fascinating/fas-
cinated poetic depiction of Capital as a rhizomatic monster/vampire that deterritorializes
and swallows all, indomitable, dynamic, ever-rising from the dead, each crisis making
it stronger, Dionysos-Phoenix reborn. . . . It is in this poetic (anti)capitalist reference to
Marx that Marx is really dead: appropriated when deprived of his political sting.
      The problem with democracy is that, the moment it is established as a positive
formal system regulating the way a multitude of political subjects compete for power, it
has to exclude some options as “nondemocratic,” and this exclusion, this founding deci-
sion about who is included in and who is excluded from the field of democratic options,
is not democratic. We are not simply playing formal-logical games here with the para-
doxes of metalanguage, since, at this precise point, Marx’s old insight remains fully
valid: this inclusion/exclusion is overdetermined by fundamental social antagonism
(“class struggle”), which, for this very reason, cannot ever be adequately translated into
the form of democratic competition. The ultimate democratic illusion—and, simulta-
neously, the point at which the limitation of democracy becomes directly palpable—is
that one can accomplish social revolution painlessly, through “peaceful means,” simply
by winning elections. This illusion is formalist in the strictest sense of the term: it ab-
stracts from the concrete framework of social relations within which the democratic
form is operative. Consequently, although there is no profit in ridiculing political de-
mocracy, one should nonetheless insist on the Marxist lesson, confirmed by the post-
Socialist craving for privatization, that political democracy has to rely on private prop-
erty. In short, the problem with democracy is not that it is a democracy but—to use the
phrase introduced apropos of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia—in its “collateral dam-
age,” in the fact that it is a form of State Power involving certain relations of production.
      Concerning the Real, one should always bear in mind the complex interconnection
of the Lacanian triad Real-Imaginary-Symbolic: the entire triad reflects itself within
each of its three elements. There are three modalities of the Real: the “real Real” (the
horrifying Thing, the primordial object, from Irma’s throat to the Alien), the “imaginary
Real” (the mysterious je ne sais quoi, the unfathomable “something” on account of
which the sublime dimension shines through an ordinary object), and the “symbolic
Real” (the real as consistency: the signifier reduced to a senseless formula, like the
quantum physics formulas which can no longer be translated back into—or related to—
the everyday experience of our life-world). The Real is thus effectively all three dimen-




diacritics / spring 2001                                                                   97
sions at the same time: the abyssal vortex which ruins every consistent structure; the
mathematized consistent structure of reality; the fragile pure appearance. And, in a strictly
homologous way, there are three modalities of the Symbolic (the real—the signifier
reduced to a senseless formula; the imaginary—the Jungian “symbols”; and the sym-
bolic—speech, meaningful language) and three modalities of the Imaginary (the real—
fantasy, which is precisely an imaginary scenario occupying the place of the Real; the
imaginary—image as such in its fundamental function of a decoy; and the symbolic—
again, the Jungian “symbols” or New Age archetypes). The triad of the Real-Imaginary-
Symbolic also determines the three modes of the subject’s decenterment: the Real (of
which neurobiology speaks: the neuronal network as the objective reality of our illusive
psychic self-experience); the Imaginary (the fundamental fantasy itself, the decentered
imaginary scenario inaccessible to my psychic experience); and the Symbolic (the sym-
bolic order as the Other Scene by whom I am spoken, which effectively pulls the strings).
     What this means is that the Real is not the hard kernel of reality that resists
virtualization. Hubert Dreyfus is right to identify the fundamental feature of today’s
virtualization of our life-experience as a reflective distance which prevents any full
engagement: as in the sexual games on the internet, you are never fully committed,
since, as one usually puts it, “when the thing doesn’t work out, you can always leave!”
When you reach an impasse, you can say “OK, I am leaving the game, I step out! Let’s
start over with a different game!”; but the very fact of this withdrawal implies that, from
the beginning, I was somehow aware that I can leave the game, which means that I was
not fully committed [see Dreyfus]. In this way, we never get really burned, fatally hurt,
since a commitment is always open to being revoked; but in an existential commitment
without reservations, if we make a mistake we lose it all—there is no way out, no “OK,
let’s start the game again!” We miss what Kierkegaard and others mean by a full exis-
tential engagement when we perceive it as a risky voluntarist jump into a dogmatic
stance, as if, instead of persisting in fully justified skepticism, we as it were lose our
nerve and fully commit ourselves; what he has in mind are precisely situations when we
are absolutely cornered and cannot step back and judge the situation from a distance—
we do not have a choice to choose or not to choose, since the withdrawal from choice is
already the (bad) choice.
     However, from the Freudian standpoint, the first thing to do is to radically question
the opposition, on which Dreyfus relies here, between human being as a fully embodied
agent, thrown into his/her life-world, acting against the impenetrable background of
preunderstanding, which can never be objectified/explicated into a set of rules, and the
human being operating in an artificial digital universe that is thoroughly rule-regulated
and thus lacks the background density of the life-world. What if our location in a life-
world is not the ultimate fact? The Freudian notion of “death drive” points precisely
toward a dimension of human subjectivity that resists its full immersion into its life-
world: it designates a blind insistence that follows its course with utter disregard for the
requirements of our concrete life-world. In Tarkovsky’s Mirror, his father Arseny
Tarkovsky recites his own lines: “A soul is sinful without a body, / like a body without
clothes”—with no project, no aim, a riddle without answer—“death drive” is this dislo-
cated soul without body, a pure insistence ignoring the constraints of reality. Gnosti-
cism is thus simultaneously right and wrong: right, insofar as it claims that the human
subject is not truly “at home” in our reality; wrong, insofar as it draws the conclusion
that, therefore, there should be another (astral, etheric . . .) universe that is our true
home, and from which we “fell” into this inert material reality. This is also where all the
postmodern-deconstructionist-poststructuralist variations on how the subject is always-
already displaced, decentered, pluralized . . . somehow misses the central point: that the
subject is “as such” the name for a certain radical displacement, a certain “wound, cut,




98
in the texture of the universe,” and all its identifications are ultimately just so many
failed attempts to heal this wound. This displacement which in itself portends entire
universes, is best rendered by the first lines of Fernando Pessoa’s “Tobacco Shop”: “I
am nothing. / I will never be anything. / I cannot desire to be nothing. / Moreover, I carry
in me all the dreams of the world.”
      Within the space of the opposition on which Dreyfus relies, the Real equals the
inertia of material bodily reality which cannot be reduced to another digital construct.
However, what one should introduce here is the good old Lacanian distinction between
reality and the Real: in the opposition between reality and spectral illusion, the Real
appears precisely as “irreal,” as a spectral illusion for which there is no space in our
(symbolically constructed) reality. Therein, in this “symbolic construction of (what we
perceive as our social) reality,” lies the catch: the inert remainder foreclosed from (what
we experience as) reality returns in the Real of spectral apparitions. What is so uncanny
about animals like shellfishes, snails, and tortoises? The true object of horror is not the
shell without the slimy body in it, but the “naked” body without the shell. That is to say,
is it not that we always tend to perceive the shell as too large, too heavy, too thick, with
regard to the living body it houses? The body never fully fits its shell. Furthermore, this
body possesses no inner skeleton which would confer upon it the minimum of stability
and firmness: deprived of its shell, the body is an almost formless spongy entity. It is as
if, in these cases, the fundamental vulnerability, the need for a safe haven of a housing
specific to humans, is projected back into nature, into the animal kingdom—in other
words, it is as if these animals are effectively humans who carry their houses along with
them. Is this squishy body not the perfect figure of the Real? The shell without the
living body within would be like the famous vase evoked by Heidegger: the symbolic
frame which delineates the contours of the Real Thing, the void in its middle—the
uncanny thing is that nonetheless “something instead of nothing” is within the shell,
although not an adequate something, but always a defective, vulnerable, ridiculously
inadequate body, the remainder of the lost Thing. The Real is thus not the prereflexive
reality of our immediate immersion in our life-world but, precisely, that which gets lost,
that which the subject has to renounce in order to become immersed in his/her life-
world—and, consequently, that which then returns in the guise of spectral apparitions.
      In short, the Real is the “almost nothing” that sustains the gap that separates a thing
from itself. The dimension we are trying to discern can best be formulated with regard
to the thorough ambiguity of the relationship between reality and the Real. The standard
“Lacanian” notion is that of reality as a grimace of the Real: the Real is the unattainable
traumatic kernel-Void, the blinding Sun impossible to sustain in a face-to-face look,
perceptible only if one looks at it awry, from the side, in a perspectival distortion—if we
look at it directly, we get “burnt by the sun.” The Real is thus structured/distorted into
the “grimace” we call reality through the pacifying symbolic network, something like
the Kantian Ding-an-sich structured into what we experience as objective reality through
the transcendental network. However, if one draws out all the consequences of the
Lacanian notion of the Real, one is compelled to invert the above-quoted formula: the
Real itself is nothing but a grimace of reality, something that is nothing but a perspec-
tival distortion of reality, something that only shines through such a distortion, since it
is “in itself” thoroughly without substance. This Real is a stain in what we perceive
“face to face,” like the devil’s face appearing in the tornado clouds in the cover photo of
News of the World, the obstacle (the proverbial “bone in the throat”) that forever distorts
our perception of reality, introducing anamorphic stains in it. The Real is the appear-
ance as appearance: it not only appears within appearances, but it is also nothing but its
own appearance. It is only a certain grimace of reality, a certain imperceptible, unfath-
omable, ultimately illusory feature that accounts for the absolute difference within the

identity. This Real is not the inaccessible Beyond of phenomena, but only their doublure,
the gap between two inconsistent phenomena, a perspectival shift. This, then, is how
one should answer the “obvious” theological counterargument (or, more simply, read-
ing) of Lacan: the Real does stand for the intervention of another dimension in the order
of our reality—and why should this other dimension not be the Divine Thing? From the
materialist standpoint, the Thing is a specter that emerges in the interstices of reality,
insofar as reality is never homogeneous/consistent, but always afflicted by the cut of
self-doubling.
     Most of Rachel Whiteread’s sculptural work consists of variations on one and the
same motif: that of directly giving body to the Void of the Thing. When, taking a created
object (a closet, a room, a house . . .), she first fills in the empty space, the void in the
middle, and then removes that which encircled and thus delineated this central void—
what we get is a massive object that directly gives body to the void itself. The standard
relationship between the void and the crust/armor/shell that created this void is thus
inverted: instead of the vase embodying the central void, this void itself is directly
materialized. The uncanny effect of these objects resides in the ways they palpably
demonstrate the ontological incompleteness of reality: such objects by definition stick
out, they are ontologically superfluous, not at the same level of reality as “normal”
objects.
     This doublure is never symmetrical. In a well-known psychological experiment,
two psychiatrists were engaged in a conversation after each was told that the other is not
really a psychiatrist, but a dangerous lunatic living under the illusion that he is a psy-
chiatrist. Afterwards, each was asked to write a professional report on his partner, and
each described in detail the other’s dangerous symptoms. Does this experiment not
realize Escher’s famous picture of the two hands drawing each other? One should none-
theless insist that, as with Escher’s drawing, the perfect symmetry is an illusion that
“cannot happen in reality”—the two persons cannot both be just an entity in the other’s
dream. The asymmetry at work here is clearly discernible in another similar case, that of
the relationship between God and man in the tradition of German mysticism (Meister
Eckhart): man is created-born by God, yet God is born in man, that is, man gives birth to
what created him. The relationship is not symmetrical here, but—to put it in Hegelese—
that of “positing the presuppositions”: God is, of course, the impenetrable/abyssal Ground
out of which man emerges; however, it is only through man that God actualizes himself,
that he “becomes what he always-already was.” What was before the creation of man an
impersonal substantial force becomes through man the divine person.
     We have thus returned to the difference between idealism and materialism: perhaps
its ultimate figure is that between these two forms of the Real. Religion is the Real as
the impossible Thing beyond phenomena, the Thing that “shines through” phenomena
in sublime experiences; atheism is the Real as grimace of reality, as the gap, the incon-
sistency, of reality. This is why the standard religious reproach to atheists (“But you
cannot really understand what it is to believe!”) has to be turned around: our “natural”
state is to believe; the truly difficult thing to grasp is the atheist position. Here one
should move against the Derridean/Levinasian assertion of the kernel of religion as the
belief in the impossible Real of a spectral Otherness that can leave its traces in our
reality—the belief that this reality of ours is not the Ultimate Reality. Atheism is not the
position of believing only in the positive (ontologically fully constituted, sutured, closed)
reality; the most succinct rien n’aura eu lieu que le lieu definition of atheism is pre-
cisely “religion without religion”—the assertion of the void of the Real deprived of any
positive content, prior to any content, the assertion that any content is a semblance
which fills in the void. “Religion without religion” is the place of religion deprived of
its content, like Mallarme’s—this is atheism’s true formula—“nothing takes place but




100
the place itself.” Although this may sound similar to the Derridean/Levinasian “Messi-
anic Otherness,” it is its exact opposite: it is not “the inner messianic Truth of religion
minus religion’s external institutional apparatuses” but, rather, the form of religion de-
prived of its content, in contrast to the Derridean/Levinasian reference to a spectral
Otherness, which does not offer the form, but the empty content of religion. Not only do
both religion and atheism insist on the Void, on the fact that our reality is not ultimate
and closed—the experience of this Void is the original materalist experience, and reli-
gion, unable to endure it, fills it in with religious content.
     And is this shift not also the shift from Kant to Hegel? From tension between phe-
nomena and Thing to an inconsistency/gap between phenomena themselves? The stan-
dard notion of reality is that of a hard kernel that resists the conceptual grasp. What
Hegel does is simply to take this notion of reality more literally: nonconceptual reality
is something that emerges when the notional self-development gets caught in an incon-
sistency and becomes nontransparent to itself. In short, the limit is transposed from
exterior to interior: Reality exists because and insofar as the Notion is inconsistent,
doesn’t coincide with itself. The multiple perspectival inconsistencies between phe-
nomena are not an effect of the impact of the transcendent Thing—on the contrary,
Thing is nothing but the ontologization of the inconsistency between phenomena. The
logic of this reversal is ultimately the same as the passage from the special to the general
theory of relativity in Einstein. While the special theory already introduces the notion of
curved space, it conceives of this curvature as the effect of matter: it is the presence of
matter that curves the space; that is, only an empty space would have been noncurved.
With the passage to the general theory, the causality is reversed: far from causing the
curvature of the space, matter is its effect. In the same way, the Lacanian Real—the
Thing—is not so much the inert presence that “curves” the symbolic space (introducing
gaps and inconsistencies in it) but, rather, the effect of these gaps and inconsistencies.
     There are two fundamentally different ways to relate to the Void, best captured by
the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise: while Achilles can easily overtake the tortoise,
he can never reach her. We posit the Void as the impossible-real Limit of human experi-
ence which we can only indefinitely approach, the absolute Thing toward which we
have to maintain a proper distance—if we get too close to it, we get burned by the sun.
Our attitude toward the Void is thus thoroughly ambiguous, marked by simultaneous
attraction and repulsion. Or we posit it as that through which we should (and, in a way,
even always-already have) pass(ed). Therein lies the gist of the Hegelian notion of “tar-
rying with the negative,” which Lacan rendered in his notion of the deep connection
between the death drive and creative sublimation: in order for (symbolic) creation to
take place, the death drive (the Hegelian self-relating absolute negativity) has to accom-
plish its work of, precisely, emptying the place and thus making it ready for creation.
Instead of the old topic of phenomenal objects disappearing/dissolving in the vortex of
the Thing, we get objects which are nothing but the Void of the Thing embodied, or, in
Hegelese, objects in which negativity assumes positive existence.
     And this brings me to Christianity: in religious terms, this passage from the Impos-
sible-Real One (Thing), refracted/reflected in the multitude of its appearances, to the
Twosome is the very passage from Judaism to Christianity—the Jewish God is the Real
Thing of Beyond, while the divine dimension of Christ is just a tiny grimace, an imper-
ceptible shade, which differentiates him from other (ordinary) humans. Christ is not
“sublime” in the sense of an “object elevated to the dignity of a Thing”: he is not a
stand-in for the impossible Thing-God; he is rather “the Thing itself,” or, more accu-
rately, “the Thing itself” is nothing but the rupture/gap that makes Christ not fully hu-
man. Christ is thus what Nietzsche, this ultimate and self-professed anti-Christ, called
“Midday”: the thin edge between Before and After, the Old and the New, the Real and




diacritics / spring 2001                                                               101
the Symbolic, between God-Father-Thing and the community of the Spirit. As such, he
is both at the same time: the extreme point of the Old (the culmination of the logic of
sacrifice, himself standing for the extreme sacrifice, for the self-relating exchange in
which we no longer pay God, but God pays for us himself and thus involves us in debt
indefinitely) and its overcoming (the shift of perspective) into the New. It is a tiny
nuance, an almost imperceptible shift in perspective, that distinguishes Christ’s sacri-
fice from the atheist assertion of life that needs no sacrifice.
     The key to Christ is provided by the figure of Job, whose suffering prefigures that
of Christ. The almost unbearable impact of the Book of Job resides not so much in its
narrative frame (the Devil appears in it as a conversational partner of God, and the two
engage in a rather cruel experiment in order to test Job’s faith), but in its final outcome.
Far from providing a satisfactory account of Job’s undeserved suffering, God’s appear-
ance at the end ultimately amounts to pure boasting, a horror show with elements of
farcical spectacle—a pure argument of authority grounded in breathtaking display of
power: “You see all that I can do? Can you do this? Who are you then to complain?” So
what we get is neither the good God letting Job know that his suffering is just an ordeal
destined to test his faith, nor a dark God beyond Law, the God of pure caprice, but rather
a God who acts like someone caught in a moment of impotence, weakness at least, who
tries to escape his predicament by empty boasting. What we get at the end is a kind of
cheap Hollywood horror show with lots of special effects—no wonder many commen-
tators tend to dismiss Job’s story as a remainder of pagan mythology that should have
been excluded from the Bible.
     Against this temptation, one should precisely locate the true greatness of Job: con-
trary to the usual notion of Job, he is not a patient sufferer, enduring his ordeal with firm
faith in God. On the contrary, he complains all the time, rejecting his fate (like Oedipus
at Colonus, who is also usually misperceived as a patient victim resigned to his fate).
When the three theologian friends visit him, their line of argumentation is the standard
ideological sophistry (if you suffer, by definition you must have done something wrong,
since God is just). However, their argumentation is not limited to the claim that Job
must somehow be guilty: what is at stake at a more radical level is the meaning(lessness)
of Job’s suffering. Like Oedipus at Colonus, Job insists on the utter meaninglessness of
his suffering. As the title of Job 27 says: “Job Maintains His Integrity.” As such, the
Book of Job provides what is perhaps the first exemplary case of the critique of ideol-
ogy in human history, laying bare the basic discursive strategies of legitimizing suffer-
ing: Job’s properly ethical dignity resides in his persistent rejection of the notion that his
suffering can have any meaning, either as punishment for his past sins or as a trial of his
faith, against the three theologians who bombard him with possible meanings. Surpris-
ingly, God takes his side at the end, claiming that every word Job has spoken was true,
while every word of the three theologians was false.
     It is with regard to this assertion of the meaninglessness of Job’s suffering that one
should insist on the parallel between Job and Christ, on Job’s suffering announcing the
Way of the Cross: Christ’s suffering is also meaningless, not an act of meaningful ex-
change. The difference, of course, is that, in the case of Christ, the gap that separates the
suffering, desperate man (Job) from God is transposed onto God himself, as His own
radical splitting or, rather, self-abandonment. What this means is that one should risk a
much more radical than usual reading of Christ’s “Father, why did you forsake me?”:
since we are dealing here not with the gap between man and God, but with the split in
God himself, the solution cannot be for God to (re)appear in all his majesty, revealing to
Christ the deeper meaning of his suffering (that he was the Innocent sacrificed to re-
deem humanity). Christ’s “Father, why did you forsake me?” is not the complaint to the
omnipotent, capricious God-Father whose ways are indecipherable to us mortal hu-




102
mans, but the complaint which hints at the impotent God: it is rather like the child who,
after believing in his father’s powerfulness, with horror discovers that his father cannot
help him. (To evoke an example from recent history: at the moment of Christ’s crucifix-
ion, God-the-Father is in a position somewhat similar to that of the Bosnian father made
to witness the gang rape of his own daughter, and to endure the ultimate trauma of her
compassionate-reproaching gaze: “Father, why did you forsake me?”). In short, with
this “Father, why did you forsake me?,” it is God-the-Father who effectively dies, re-
vealing his utter impotence, and thereupon rises from the dead in the guise of the Holy
Ghost. The passage from Judaism to Christianity is thus again the passage from purifi-
cation to subtraction: from the deadly fascination with the transcendent God-Thing to
the minimal difference that makes Christ-man divine.
      What one should emphasize is that this reading of Christianity is strictly material-
ist. In our politically correct times, it is always advisable to start with the set of unwrit-
ten prohibitions that define the positions one is allowed to assume. The first thing to
note with regard to religious matters is that reference to “deep spirituality” is again in,
and direct materialism is out; one is rather solicited to harbor openness toward a radical
Otherness beyond the onto-theological God. Consequently, when, today, one directly
asks an academic, “OK, let’s go to the basic fact: do you believe in some form of the
divine or not?,” the first answer is an embarrassed withdrawal, as if the question is too
intimate, too probing; this withdrawal is then usually explicated in more “theoretical”
terms: “It is the wrong question to ask! It is not simply a matter of believing or not but,
rather, a matter of certain radical experience, of the ability to open oneself to certain
unheard-of dimensions, of the way our openness to the radical Otherness allows us to
adopt a specific ethical stance, to participate in certain unique social practices, to ex-
perience a shattering form of enjoyment. . . .” Against this, one should insist more than
ever that the “vulgar” question “Do you really believe or not?” matters—more than
ever, perhaps.
      What one sees today is a kind of “suspended” belief, a belief that can thrive only as
not fully (publicly) admitted, as a private obscene secret. This suspended status of our
beliefs accounts for the predominant “antidogmatic” stance: one should modestly ac-
cept that all our positions are relative, conditioned by contingent historical constella-
tions, so that no one has definitive Solutions, just pragmatic temporary solutions. . . .
The falsity of this stance was denounced by Gilbert Keith Chesterton: “At any street
corner we may meet a man who utters the frantic and blasphemous statement that he
may be wrong. Every day one comes across somebody who says that of course his view
may not be the right one. Of course his view must be the right one, or it is not his view”
[37]. Is the same falsity not clearly discernible in the rhetoric of many a postmodern
deconstructionist? Is their apparently modest relativization of their own position not the
mode of appearance of its very opposite, of privileging their own position of enuncia-
tion, so that one can effectively claim that the self-relativizing stance is a key ingredient
of today’s rhetorics of power? Compare the struggle and pain of the “fundamentalist”
with the serene peace of the liberal democrat who, from a safe subjective position,
ironically dismisses every fully pledged engagement, every “dogmatic” taking sides.
Consequently, yes, I plead guilty: in this choice, I without hesitation opt for the “funda-
mentalist.”

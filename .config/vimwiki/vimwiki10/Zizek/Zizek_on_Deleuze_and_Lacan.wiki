                       The Inverse Side of the Structure:
                         ZHizhek on Deleuze on Lacan*

            I N AN INTERVIEW IN 1995, shortly before his death, Gilles Deleuze was asked by
            French scholar Didier Eribon about his relationship with Jacques Lacan. In
            response, Deleuze told the following story:
                 Lacan noticed me when he devoted a session of his seminar to my book
                 on Sacher-Masoch [1967].1 I was told—although I never knew any-
                 thing more than this—that he had devoted more than an hour to my
                 book. And then he came to a conference at Lyon, where I was then teach-
                 ing. He gave an absolutely unbelievable lecture. . . . It was there that he
                 uttered his famous formula, “Psychoanalysis can do everything except
                 make an idiot seem intelligible.” After the conference, he came to our place
                 for dinner. And since he went to bed very late, he stayed a long time. I
                 remember: it was after midnight and he absolutely had to have a special
                 whisky. It was truly a nightmare, that night.
                    My only great encounter with him was after the appearance of Anti-
                 Oedipus [1972].2 I’m sure he took it badly. He must have held it against
                 us, Félix and me. But finally, a few months later, he summoned me—
                 there’s no other word for it. He wanted to see me. And so I went. He
                 made me wait in his antechamber. It was filled with people, I didn’t
                 know if they were patients, admirers, journalists. . . . He made me wait
                 a long time—a little too long, all the same—and then he finally
                 received me. He rolled out a list of all his disciples, and said that they
                 were all worthless [nuls] (the only person he said nothing bad about
                 was Jacques-Alain Miller). It made me smile, because I recalled Bin-
                 swanger telling the story of a similar scene: Freud saying bad things

                  about Jones, Abraham, etc. And Binswanger was shrewd enough to
                  assume that Freud would say the same thing about him when he wasn’t
                  there. So Lacan was speaking, and everyone was condemned, except
                  Miller. And then he said to me, “What I need is someone like you” [C’est
                  quelqu’un comme vous qu’il me faut.].3

                  This is a revealing anecdote, for at least two reasons. First, one might say that
            the disciple Lacan wound up “getting” was not Gilles Deleuze but Slavoj ZHizhek
            (among others), which puts ZHizhek’s encounter with Deleuze in Organs without
            Bodies (hereafter, OB) in an interesting retrospective light. Second, and more
            importantly, Deleuze’s personal encounter with Lacan took place after the publi-
            cation of Anti-Oedipus (hereafter, AO) in 1972. Anti-Oedipus presents, among
            other things, a famous critique (though not rejection) of psychoanalysis, which
            Deleuze and Guattari pursued, in part, by means of an engagement with Lacan’s
            work. In this sense one could say that Deleuze was indeed a Lacanian, but in the
            exact same manner that he was a Spinozist or a Leibnizian: he was neither a slav-
            ish follower nor a dogmatic reader of Lacan, but followed the internal trajectory
            of Lacan’s thought to the point where he would push it to its “differential” limit
            (Deleuze’s all-too-well-known image of philosophical “buggery,” which makes
            thinkers produce their own “monstrous” children). Despite Deleuze’s initial wor-
            ries about Lacan’s reaction to Anti-Oedipus, Lacan obviously did not dismiss the
            book. On the contrary, not only was his reading of the book the apparent basis of
            his “summons” to Deleuze, but he even seems to have been influenced by Anti-
            Oedipus in his own thinking. ZHizhek himself suggests that Lacan’s later work (after
            Seminar XI in 1964) is marked by an increased interest in the theory of the drives
            and anti-Oedipal themes (OB 102, 176). Given the complex status of the
            drives that one finds elaborated in Anti-Oedipus (for instance, the thesis that the
            “drives are part of the infrastructure itself,” AO 63), one can assume that Lacan
            saw Deleuze neither as an antagonistic critic, nor even a potential bearer of ortho-
            doxy (à la Miller), but rather a highly original fellow traveler.
                  This is what makes Organs without Bodies a bit of a disappointment, as well
            as a sharp departure from Lacan’s own relationship to Deleuze. It is not so much
            that only about a quarter of ZHizhek’s book (if that) is actually devoted to Deleuze,
            and the rest is ZHizhek doing his own thing. It is not even so much that ZHizhek mis-
            reads Deleuze on this or that point: Deleuze himself wrote that “encounters
            between independent thinkers always occur in a blind zone,” and this is certainly
            true of the encounter between ZHizhek and Deleuze.4 The disappointment is that
            even though ZHizhek describes Organs without Bodies as “a Lacanian book on
            Deleuze” (OB xi), he winds up saying nothing whatsoever about Deleuze’s own
            work on Lacan. This, perhaps, is just a thwarted expectation: I had hoped to find
            in ZHizhek’s book a kind of guide through the complexities of the Deleuze-Lacan
            encounter, yet nothing of the sort appears in the book. Instead, early on, ZHizhek

                                      The Inverse Side of the Structure                           637
            quickly and curtly dismisses Anti-Oedipus as “arguably Deleuze’s worst book”
            (21) and immediately turns his attention elsewhere.
                  In this, Organs without Bodies bears a strange resemblance to Alain Badiou’s
            1997 book, Deleuze: The Clamor of Being. Badiou had seen Deleuze as his primary
            rival in developing an “ontology of the multiple,” and he opens his book by
            expressly declaring that the source of his controversy with Deleuze was their dif-
            fering philosophical conceptions of “multiplicities.”5 Yet as one reads on, one
            quickly discovers that the book does not contain a single discussion of Deleuze’s
            theory of multiplicities; it ignores the topic entirely. Instead, Badiou is content
            simply to reiterate, ad nauseum, the dubious claim that Deleuze is really just a
            thinker of “the One”—almost like a politician avoiding reporters’ questions by
            doggedly sticking to his talking points. ZHizhek admits that he relied “extensively”
            on Badiou’s reading of Deleuze (OB 20n), and he rather slavishly adopts its the-
            ses and winds up reproducing a number of its errors regarding “univocity” and
            “vitalism” (Deleuze, ZHizhek dutifully repeats, is “the last great philosopher of the
            One” [121; cf. 28]). But the resemblance to Badiou is stylistic as well as substan-
            tive, since one finds a similar strategy of avoidance and displacement in ZHizhek’s
            book—a “Lacanian” book on Deleuze that does not contain a single discussion of
            Deleuze’s reading of Lacan. Taking up Deleuze’s own image, ZHizhek claims that he
            is engaging in a kind of “Hegelian [and, one might add, Lacanian] buggery of
            Deleuze” (48, italics in original). The ultimate aim of his book is to show us that
            Deleuze is “much closer to psychoanalysis and Hegel” (xi) than we might have
            expected—in other words, that Deleuze is really a kind of ZHizhekian avant la lettre
            (69). As a result, ZHizhek’s reading of Deleuze, at its most positive, is often little more
            than a transcription of Deleuze’s concepts into ZHizhek’s own Lacanian (and
            Hegelian) terminology. One does not begrudge ZHizhek his project—he is certainly
            one of the most engaging and prolific thinkers alive today—but then one won-
            ders why the detour through Deleuze was necessary at all, except as a kind of
            exercise in pop-Hegelian sublation.
                  Nonetheless, there is a serious “reading” of Deleuze taking place in the midst
            of all the buggery. ZHizhek issues his perfunctory dismissal of Anti-Oedipus (1972)
            in order to elevate Logic of Sense (1969) to the status of Deleuze’s pivotal work (no
            doubt, once again, in deference to the master, since Lacan also discussed Logic of
            Sense in a session of his seminar). Deleuze himself summarized the fundamental
            question he was attempting to address in the Logic of Sense in the following man-
            ner: “How can we maintain both that sense produces even the states of affairs in
            which it is embodied [sense as a principle of the production of beings], and that it
            is itself produced by these states of affairs or the actions and passions of bodies
            [sense as an impassive effect of material causes]?”6 ZHizhek feigns a certain surprise
            that no one (before him) had perceived this tension (production versus effect)
            that lies at the heart of Logic of Sense, and he claims that it in fact holds the key to
            Deleuze’s entire work (OB 21). The “conceptual edifice” of Deleuze’s philosophy,
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)       9/15/05      11:29 AM      Page 638




            638                                Daniel W. Smith
            ZHizhek argues, oscillates between these two “logics” of sense (or of the event),
            which are “fundamentally incompatible” (20). “Is this opposition not that of
            materialism versus idealism? In Deleuze this means: The Logic of Sense versus
            Anti-Oedipus” (21). Put summarily, one finds two competing ontologies in
            Deleuze—one good, the other bad and naïve: “sense as effect” is the good ontol-
            ogy, “sense as production” is the bad ontology. Sense as “effect” is good because it
            is Lacanian: the event is the irruption of the Real within the domain of causality
            (produced by a “quasi-cause,” which ZHizhek revealingly identifies as both “the
            exact equivalent of Lacan’s objet petit a” [27] as well as Deleuze’s “name for the
            Lacanian ‘phallic signifier’” [93]—thereby conflating the two poles of Lacan’s
            theory of desire that Deleuze kept separate). “The basic premise of Deleuze ontol-
            ogy [in Logic of Sense] is precisely that corporeal causality is not complete. In the
            emergence of the New, something occurs that cannot be described at the level of
            corporeal causes and effect” (27). This something is the event, that is, “the point
            of non-sense sustaining the flow of sense . . . [which] fills in the gap of corporeal
            causality” (28, 27). This gap entails a “positive notion of lack, a ‘generative’
            absence” (35), “an irreducible crack in the edifice of Being” (41). This gap is the
            true domain of politics, since it marks the difference between “the explosion of
            revolutionary Events” and the “‘objective’ material/socioeconomic processes tak-
            ing place in reality” (32). Hence the dualism that Badiou establishes between
            “being” and “event.”
                  For this reason, the sole interpretive question that arises for ZHizhek is this:
            how and why did Deleuze move from the beautifully Lacanian Logic of Sense to
            the misguided and non-Lacanian Anti-Oedipus? The response to this question ini-
            tially seems ad hominem: the culprit is the Félix Guattari virus that infected
            Deleuze’s thought. Like many others (Derrida, Badiou), ZHizhek makes a rather easy
            distinction between the “good” Deleuze (the solo Deleuze) and the “bad” Deleuze
            (Deleuze with Guattari). Guattari’s influence was partly political; the solo
            Deleuze, ZHizhek notes, was “a highly elitest author, indifferent to politics” (OB 20).
            Deleuze himself admitted that Anti-Oedipus had indeed marked a profound
            transformation in his work: “For my part, I made a sort of move into politics
            around May 68, as I came into contact with specific problems, through Guattari,
            through Foucault, through Elie Sambar. Anti-Oedipus was from beginning to end
            a book of political philosophy.”7 But behind the ad hominem musings there lies
            a more substantive claim: “The only serious philosophical question is what inher-
            ent impasse caused Deleuze to turn toward Guattari?” (20). According to ZHizhek,
            the impasse was precisely the tension between the good ontology and the bad
            ontology: “Was Deleuze not pushed toward Guattari because Guattari repre-
            sented an alibi, an easy escape from the deadlock of his previous position” (21).
            The easy escape was the abandoning of a good Lacanian ontology (event as effect)
            for a bad Guattarian ontology (event as production and becoming): “Deleuze
            deploys the One-Substance as the indifferent medium of multitude” (33). Such,
            in short, is the upshot of the story that one finds in ZHizhek’s brief engagement with
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)        9/15/05      11:29 AM       Page 639

            Deleuze: a good Lacanian moment in Logic of Sense is immediately betrayed by
            Anti-Oedipus and the evil Félix Guattari. If Deleuze had stuck with the insights of
            Logic of Sense, he would have been able to enter into a becoming-ZHizhek, and not
            wandered off into the desert of Guattari.
                  But would it be possible to follow Lacan himself and read Anti-Oedipus as
            something other than Deleuze’s worst book? How can we understand Lacan’s own
            positive reaction to Anti-Oedipus? Is there perhaps a fidelity to Lacan’s thought in
            Anti-Oedipus that is more profound than the rather easy appropriation found in
            Logic of Sense? ZHizhek is certainly correct to sense a shift in Deleuze’s thought
            between Logic of Sense and Anti-Oedipus. “The surface-depth problem [of Logic of
            Sense] no longer concerns me,” Deleuze remarked in a 1973 interview. “What
            interests me now are the relations between a full body, a body without organs, and
            flows that migrate.”8 And ZHizhek is also correct to sense that this shift had some-
            thing to do with Deleuze’s association with Guattari. Deleuze later explained:
            “Oddly enough, it wasn’t me who rescued Félix from psychoanalysis; he rescued
            me. In my study on Masoch, and then in Logic of Sense, I thought I’d discovered
            things about the specious unity of sadism and masochism, or about events, that
            contradicted psychoanalysis but could be reconciled with it. Félix, on the other
            hand, had been and was still a psychoanalyst, a student of Lacan’s, but like a ‘son’
            who already knew that reconciliation was impossible. Anti-Oedipus marks a
            break.”9 But what ZHizhek does not seem to realize (as Lacan obviously did) is that
            Deleuze’s break with psychoanalysis was brought about by none other than Lacan
            himself. Anti-Oedipus is, from start to finish, a reading of Lacan, and no doubt it
            would have had Lacan’s name in the title had not so much else been going on in
            the book. Lacan is often presented as having effected a linguistic and structural
            reinterpretation of Freud. For Deleuze, however, this is not where Lacan’s signifi-
            cance lies. “It’s all very well to say to us: you understand nothing, Oedipus, it’s not
            daddy-mummy, it’s the symbolic, the law, the arrival of culture, it’s the effect of the
            signifier, it’s the finitude of the subject, it’s the ‘lack-of-being’ [manqué-à-être]
            which is life.”10 Lacan’s significance, rather, lies in the way in which he was able to
            push psychoanalysis to the point of its auto-critique, and it is precisely this Lacan-
            ian critique of psychoanalysis that Deleuze and Guattari take up and pursue in
            Anti-Oedipus. “There are problems that troubled Freud toward the end of his life:
            something is not right with psychoanalysis, something is stuck. Freud thought
            that it was becoming endless, the cure looked interminable, it was going nowhere.
            And Lacan was the first to indicate how far things had to be revamped.”11 Despite
            its reputation, Anti-Oedipus does not contain a single negative comment about
            Lacan, although it is occasionally critical of the direction his thought was taken by
            certain of his disciples, and of the orthodoxy that grew up around him.
                  This is all the more reason to regret the fact that ZHizhek, as a Lacanian, chose to
            overlook the Deleuze-Lacan encounter and to dismiss Anti-Oedipus in a way that
            Lacan himself did not. Perhaps someday a reader with the competence to do so will
            analyze the outlines and the consequences of this encounter.12 Lacking that

            competence, I can at least list a number of points that might be relevant to such an
            analysis, some of which ZHizhek has touched on, at least in passing, in his book.


                                     Immanence and Transcendence

                  Deleuze has presented himself, famously, as a philosopher of immanence, and
            his critique of psychoanalysis is undertaken from the perspective of immanence.
            What Is Philosophy? identifies three types of transcendence that have been constant
            temptations away from immanence: (1) contemplation, or the transcendence of the
            Idea (Plato); (2) reflection, or the transcendence of the Subject (Kant); and then (3)
            a third type, which we might call the transcendence of the Breach or Rupture. “In
            this modern moment,” Deleuze writes, “we are no longer satisfied with thinking
            immanence as immanent to a transcendent; we want to think transcendence within
            the immanent, and it is from immanence that a breach is expected.”13 In other
            words, to cite some well-known examples, it is from within immanence itself that
            one now seeks to locate “inconsistency” or the “void” (Badiou), or from which one
            seeks to find a “gap” or “rupture” within immanence, the “irruption” of the Real.
            Whatever the terminology, Deleuze suggests, it is always the same model—”mak-
            ing us think that immanence is a prison from which the Transcendent will save
            us.”14 ZHizhek candidly admits that this modern model of transcendence is his own
            model: “‘Transcendence’ is the illusory reflection of the fact that the immanence of
            phenomena is ruptured, broken, inconsistent” (OB 61). This new conception of
            transcendence, he notes, no longer refers either to a Beyond (God) or a Subject, but
            rather to “the gap within immanence” (62). Immanence is what is given, what is
            actual; we therefore need to discover the breach, the rupture, the gap, the torsion
            or twist, that will save us from the actuality of the immanent (Being as multiple)
            through an irruption of the new (the Event, the transcendence within immanence).
            ZHizhek then asks the necessary question: “What if this gap in immanence is what
            Deleuze cannot accept?” (61). And ZHizhek is indeed correct: Deleuze does not accept
            this modern appeal to transcendence in psychoanalytic thought. “How many inter-
            pretations of Lacanianism,” Deleuze asks, “overtly or secretly pious, have in this
            manner invoked . . . a gap in the Symbolic? . . . Despite some fine books by certain
            disciples of Lacan, we wonder if Lacan’s thought really goes in this direction” (AO
            83, 53). In other words, it is out of fidelity to Lacan’s thought that Deleuze rejects the
            appeal to a gap in immanence.


                                           The Status of the Real

                  How then does Deleuze break with this model? In certain respects, what is
            at stake in this question is the status of the Real, in the Lacanian sense, and ZHizhek
            recognizes this. “What matters to Deleuze is not virtual reality but the reality of the
            virtual (which, in Lacanian terms, is the Real)” (OB 3). In fact, Deleuze and Guat-
            tari explicitly characterize Anti-Oedipus as being, from start to finish, a theory of

            the Real. “We were unable to posit any difference in nature, any border line, any
            limit at all between the Imaginary and the Symbolic. . . . The true difference in
            nature is not between the Symbolic and the Imaginary, but between the Real
            machinic element, which constitutes desiring-production, and the structural
            whole of the Imaginary and the Symbolic, which merely forms a myth and its
            variants” (AO 83). The aim of the book, they tell us, is “to renew, at the level of the
            Real, the tie between the analytic machine, desire, and production” (53). In their
            language, the Real = desiring - production. The unconscious “is neither Imagi-
            nary nor Symbolic, it is the Real in itself, the ‘impossible real’ and its produc-
            tion. . . . The machines of desire . . . constitute the Real in itself, beyond or beneath
            the Symbolic as well as the Imaginary” (53). (Deleuze and Guattari will nonethe-
            less insist that “the real is not impossible; on the contrary, within the Real every-
            thing is possible, everything becomes possible. . . . It is only in the structure [the
            symbolic] that the fusion of desire with the impossible is performed, with lack
            defined as castration” [27, 306]). What is it that allows Deleuze to link the Real
            with the theory of desire in this manner (desire = production)?


                                       The Kantian Theory of Desire

                  Anti-Oedipus can be said to find its primary model in the Critique of Practical Rea-
            son, since it was Kant who first defined the faculty of desire as a productive faculty (“a
            faculty which, by means of its representations, is the cause of the actuality of the
            objects of those representations”).15 We know why Kant defined desire in terms of
            production: the problem of freedom concerns the operation by which a free being
            can be the cause of something that is not reducible to the causal determinism of
            mechanism. Of course, Kant was aware that real objects could be produced only by
            an external causality and external mechanisms; in what he called “pathological” pro-
            ductions of desire, what is produced is merely a psychic reality (having a fantastic, hal-
            lucinatory, or delirious object) (AO 25). Nonetheless, this was Kant’s Copernican
            Revolution in practical philosophy: desire is no longer defined in terms of lack (I
            desire something because I don’t have it), but rather in terms of production (I produce
            the object because I desire it). The fundamental thesis of Anti-Oedipus is a stronger
            variant of Kant’s claim; Kant pushed to his necessary conclusion: “If desire produces,
            its product is real,” and not merely a fantasy (26). “There is no particular form of exis-
            tence that can be labeled ‘psychic reality’” (27). Indeed, Deleuze states this conclu-
            sion in explicitly Lacanian terms: “The objective being of desire is the Real in and of
            itself” (the subject itself is a product of desire) (27).


                                           Desire and Immanence

                 But Deleuze is clearly not a Kantian in any straightforward sense. For Kant,
            the fundamental question concerns the higher form (nonpathological) of the fac-
            ulty of desire: a faculty has a higher form when it finds within itself the law of its
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)         9/15/05      11:29 AM       Page 642




            642                                  Daniel W. Smith
            own exercise, and thus functions autonomously. The higher form of desire is
            what Kant calls the “will”: desire becomes will when it is determined by the rep-
            resentation of a pure form (the moral law), which is the pure form of a universal
            legislation (the categorical imperative). In Kant, however, freedom, as the “fact”
            of morality, requires as it postulates the three great transcendent Ideas of the Soul,
            the World, and God. It is precisely the transcendence of the Moral Law that ren-
            ders its object unknowable and elusive. Was this not what Lacan himself showed
            in his famous essay “Kant avec Sade,” to which Deleuze admits his indebted-
            ness?16 Anti-Oedipus can thus be said to have effected an immanent inversion of
            Kant (though it is no longer concerned with the synthesis of consciousness, but
            with the syntheses of the unconscious). In the first two chapters of Anti-Oedipus,
            Deleuze provides a purely immanent characterization of the three syntheses of
            the unconscious—connection (which forms a counter-Self, and no longer a Soul),
            conjunction (which forms a “chaosmos” and no longer a World), and disjunction
            (which exchanges its theological principle for a diabolical one)—and shows how
            desire (as the principle of production) constitutes the Real by tracing series and
            trajectories following these syntheses within a given social assemblage. “The Real
            is the end product, the result of the passive syntheses that engineer partial syn-
            theses of desire as auto-production of the unconscious.”17


                                              Lacan’s Oscillation

                  But, Deleuze asks, was not Lacan’s own thought already moving in this
            immanent direction in 1972? In Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari identified
            two poles in Lacan’s theory of desire (which ZHizhek seems to conflate): “Lacan’s
            admirable theory of desire appears to us to have two poles: one related to ‘the
            object small a’ as a desiring-machine, which defines desire in terms of a real pro-
            duction, thus going beyond any idea of need and any idea of fantasy; and the
            other related to the ‘great Other’ as a signifier, which reintroduces a certain notion
            of lack” (AO 27n). The innovation of Anti-Oedipus was that it attempted to follow
            the first path laid out by Lacan (an immanent concept of desire related to the objet
            petit a), despite the efforts of Lacan’s “first disciples” (83) to push his thought in
            the second “Oedipal” direction (desire related to the transcendence of the phal-
            lic signifier). Deleuze and Guattari admit that the oscillation between these two
            poles of desire was present within Lacan’s own thought:

                  We owe to Jacques Lacan the discovery of this fertile domain of a code
                  of the unconscious, incorporating the entire chain—or several
                  chains—of sense: a discovery thus totally transforming analysis . . . The
                  chains are called “signifying chains” because they are made up of signs,
                  but these signs are not themselves signifying. . . . If the first disciples were
                  tempted to re-close the Oedipal [Symbolic] yoke, didn’t they do so to
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)       9/15/05      11:29 AM      Page 643




                                     The Inverse Side of the Structure                         643
                 the extent that Lacan seemed to maintain a kind of projection of the sig-
                 nifying chains onto a despotic signifier? . . . The signs of desire, being
                 non-signifying, become signifying in representation only in terms of a
                 signifier of absence or lack.” (38, 83, italics added)

            Following Lacan, Anti-Oedipus thus attempts to analyze the means by which the
            legitimate and immanent syntheses of desire (partial connections, inclusive dis-
            junctions, polyvocal conjunctions—the Real production of desire, the objet petit
            a) are inverted and converted into illegitimate and transcendent syntheses (global
            connections, exclusive disjunctions, biunivocal conjunctions—the Oedipal or
            Symbolic representation of desire via the “phallic signifier”).


                                    Lacan’s Anti-Oedipal Trajectory

                  But once again, despite this oscillation, was it not Lacan himself who was
            pushing psychoanalysis away from Oedipus and the Symbolic? ZHizhek complains
            that “what Deleuze presents as ‘Oedipus’ is a rather ridiculous simplification, if
            not an outright falsification, of Lacan’s position” (OB 80), pointing to the constant
            references to “au-delà de l’Oedipe” in the last decades of Lacan’s teaching. But
            Deleuze and Guattari would agree with this latter characterization—in their eyes,
            Lacan is himself the great anti-Oedipal thinker (they approvingly cite Lacan’s
            1970 claim that “I have never spoken of an Oedipus complex” [AO 53n]). Lacan,
            they write, “was not content to turn, like the analytic squirrel, inside the wheel of
            the Imaginary and the Symbolic” (308). The Real is the internal limit to any
            process of symbolization, but it was not enough for Lacan to describe the Real,
            negatively, as a resistant kernel within the symbolic process upon whose inter-
            nalized exclusion the symbolic is constituted (negation or exclusion as constitu-
            tive). Rather, Lacan was pushing psychoanalysis to “the point of its self critique”
            (310), where the Real would be able to appear in all its positivity: “the point
            where the structure, beyond the images that fill it [fantasies] and the Symbolic
            that conditions it within representation, reveals its reverse side as a positive prin-
            ciple of nonconsistency that dissolves it” (311, italics added). Deleuze and Guattari
            thus present Anti-Oedipus as continuing a trajectory that was initiated by Lacan
            himself. “It was inopportune to tighten the nuts and bolts where Lacan had just
            loosened them . . . The object (small o) erupts at the heart of the structural equi-
            librium in the manner of an infernal machine, the desiring-machine” (83).


                                       The Real and Schizophrenia

                 Deleuze’s term for the Real is “schizophrenia as a pure process” (which must
            be distinguished from the schizophrenic as a clinical entity), and it is with this con-
            cept that Deleuze takes Lacan’s thought to its limit and conclusion. “It is this entire
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)        9/15/05      11:29 AM       Page 644




            644                                 Daniel W. Smith
            reverse side of the [symbolic] structure that Lacan discovers . . . schizophrenizing
            the analytic field, instead of oedipalizing the psychotic field” (AO 309). Following
            directions indicated by Lacan himself, Anti-Oedipus attempts to describe the Real
            in all its positivity: differential partial objects or intensities that enter into indirect
            syntheses; pure positive multiplicities where everything is possible (transverse
            connections, polyvocal conjunctions, included disjunctions); signs of desire that
            compose a signifying chain, but which are themselves non-signifying, and so on
            (309). The domain of the Real is a “sub-representative field” (300), but Deleuze
            does not hesitate to claim that “we have the means to penetrate the sub-
            representational” (italics added).18 Conversely, if the Real is the sub-representative,
            then “illusion” (if one wants to retain this word) only appears afterward, in the
            actual: it is only within the symbolic (representation) that desire appears nega-
            tively as lack, as castration. It is for this reason that Deleuze suggests that schizo-
            phrenia provides a better clue to the nature of the unconscious and the Real than
            neurosis: psychotics resist therapeutization because they have a libido that is too
            liquid or viscous, they resist entry into the symbolic (foreclosure), mistaking
            words for things. But “rather than being a resistance of the ego, this is the intense
            outcry of all of desiring-production” (67). Some of Deleuze’s most profound texts
            (such as “Louis Wolfson; or, The Procedure”) are those that analyze the specifically
            schizophrenic uses of language, which push language to its limit and lay waste its
            significations, designations, and translations.19 Deleuze suggests that the usual
            negative diagnostic criteria that have been proposed for schizophrenia—dissoci-
            ation, detachment from reality, autism—are, above all, useful terms for not listen-
            ing to schizophrenics. But in the end, this problem is not specific to
            schizophrenics: “we are all libidos that are too viscous and too fluid . . . [which]
            bears witness to the non-oedipal quality of the flows of desire” (67; cf. 312).


                                         The Body without Organs

                 Hence, whereas Logic of Sense was content to remain at the surface of sense
            (like Lewis Carroll), Anti-Oedipus can be said to have plunged into the depth of
            bodies (Artaud): the logic of the passive syntheses (the Real) ultimately finds its
            model in the body—or more precisely, the “body without organs.”20 This well-
            known but complex Deleuzian notion has three fundamental components.
            Schizophrenics experience their organs in a nonorganic manner, that is, as ele-
            ments or singularities that are connected to other elements in the complex func-
            tioning of a “machinic assemblage” (connective synthesis). But the breakdown of
            these organ-machines reveals a second theme—that of the body without organs,
            a nonproductive surface upon which the anorganic functioning of the organs is
            stopped dead in a kind of catatonic stupor (disjunctive synthesis). These two
            poles—the vital anorganic functioning of the organs and their frozen catatonic
            stasis, with all the variations of attraction and repulsion that exist between
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)        9/15/05      11:29 AM       Page 645




                                      The Inverse Side of the Structure                          645
            them—can be said to translate the entire anguish of the schizophrenic, which in
            turn points to a third theme, that of intensive variations (conjunctive synthesis).
            These poles are never separate from each other, but generate between them various
            forms in which sometimes repulsion dominates, and sometimes attraction: the
            paranoid form of schizophrenia (repulsion), and its miraculating or fantastic form
            (attraction). Schizophrenics tend to experience these oscillating intensities (manic
            rises in intensity, depressive falls in intensity . . . ) in an almost pure state. Beneath
            the hallucinations of the senses (“I see,” “I hear”) and the deliriums of thought (“I
            think”), there is something more profound, a feeling of intensity—that is, a becom-
            ing or a transition (“I feel”). A gradient is crossed, a threshold is surpassed or
            retreated from, a migration is brought about: “I feel that I am becoming woman,” “I
            feel that I am becoming god,” “I feel that I am becoming pure matter. . . .” The inno-
            vation of Anti-Oedipus is to have penetrated into this sub-representative, schizo-
            phrenic domain of the body without organs and made use of it as the model for the
            unconscious itself. The analysis of this unconscious entails a corresponding prac-
            tice that Deleuze and Guattari will term “schizoanalysis.”


                                   Psychoanalysis and Schizoanalysis

                  What then is the difference between psychoanalysis and schizoanalysis? “Psy-
            choanalysis settles on the imaginary [fantasy] and structural [symbolic] represen-
            tatives of reterritorialization, while schizoanalysis follows the machinic indices of
            deterritorialization” (AO 316). One can only admire the enthusiasm with which
            ZHizhek analyzes the first movement, particularly in his section the “phallus” (the
            “organ without a body” of the title) (see OB 87–95). The phallus, as the signifier of
            castration, is what effects a desexualization of the libido, and makes possible the
            “impossible” passage of the body (the drives) into symbolic thought, the passage
            from bodily depth to surface event (symbolic castration). Deleuze and Guattari
            could no doubt even agree with ZHizhek’s claim that Oedipus is an “operator of deter-
            ritorialization” (83), insofar as every movement of deterritorialization (of the
            drives) is accompanied by a reterritorialization (onto the symbolic). “Schizophre-
            nia as a process, deterritorialization as a process,” they write, “is inseparable from
            the stases that interrupt it, aggravate it, or make it turn in circles, and reterritori-
            alize it into neurosis, perversion, and psychosis” (the latter being the three main
            categories in Lacan’s diagnostic schema) (AO 318). Oedipus and castration are
            indeed realities that psychoanalysis did not invent. But schizoanalysis, by con-
            trast, moves in the exact opposite direction and seeks to locate the indices of deter-
            ritorialization, within these reterritorializations, in a completely different manner
            than psychoanalysis: “not the gaping wound represented in castration [the gap in
            immanence], but the myriad little connections, disjunctions, and conjunctions”
            that constitute the real movement of the immanent process of desire (314). Put
            crudely, psychoanalysis begins with the symbolic and seeks out the “gaps” that
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)       9/15/05     11:29 AM      Page 646




            646                               Daniel W. Smith
            mark the irruption of an “impossible” Real; whereas schizoanalysis starts with the
            Real as the immanent process of desire and seeks to mark both the interruptions
            of this process (reterritorializations) and its continuations and transformations
            (becomings, intensities . . . ).


                                       The Assembling of Desire

                 The fundamental concept in Deleuze’s theory of desire is thus the concept of
            the assemblage [agencement]. There exists a common but misguided critique of
            Deleuze and Guattari that claims that in subtracting desire from lack, the law, and
            castration, they wind up invoking a state of nature, a desire that would be a nat-
            ural and spontaneous reality that winds up being repressed by society.21 But
            Deleuze and Guattari’s argument is precisely the opposite: there is no desire other
            than assembled [agencé] desire. “Desire is never either a ‘natural’ or a ‘sponta-
            neous’ determination . . . never a ‘natural reality,’” writes Deleuze, but always
            results from “a highly developed, engineered setup [montage] rich in interac-
            tions,” and it can neither be grasped nor conceived apart from a determined social
            assemblage or apparatus.22 Desire, as “desiring-production,” is both productive
            and produced. Within any given assemblage of desire, there are, on the one hand,
            rigid lines of sedimentation and reterritorialization that tend to “normalize”
            desire, to “represent” or “symbolize” it; and then, on the other hand, there are
            supple lines of creativity and deterritorialization (lines of flight or escape) that
            allow the assemblage to transform itself, or even to break down in favor of a future
            assemblage. These two types of vectors are immanent to any process of desire, to
            every “desiring-machine.” What mechanisms of repression crush is not desire as
            a natural given, but precisely these cutting edges of assemblages of desire (the
            production of the new).23 The question at every moment concerns the vector that
            desire is in the process of constructing or assembling (deterritorialization and
            reterritorialization). But yet again, one must stress that it was Lacan himself who
            posed the question of desire in terms of these two poles or vectors: “In Lacan, the
            symbolic organization of the structure, with its exclusions that come from the
            function of the signifier, has as its reverse side the real inorganization of desire”
            (AO 328, italics added; cf. 39).


                              Desexualization and Political Philosophy

                 Finally, a brief comment about the relationship between Deleuze’s political
            philosophy and his theory of desire. Freud held strongly to the hypothesis that
            the libido does not invest the sociopolitical field except on the condition that it
            be “desexualized” or “sublimated”—a hypothesis that ZHizhek takes up and
            defends (“Sexuality can universalize itself only by way of desexualization” [OB
            91]). Deleuze and Guattari explicitly reject this Freudian principle. “Our entire
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)        9/15/05      11:29 AM       Page 647




                                      The Inverse Side of the Structure                          647
            hypothesis is, on the contrary, that the social field is invested by a sexual libido as
            such, and that this is in fact the fundamental activity of the libido.”24 The concepts
            of sublimation and desexualization are linked to the implicit familialism of psy-
            choanalysis. “At least in the beginning,” the argument goes, the unconscious is
            expressed in familial relations, and social relations only arise afterward. “‘Sym-
            bolic castration’ is a way for the subject to be thrown out of the family network,
            propelled into a wider social network” (83). Against this familiar Freudian notion,
            Deleuze and Guattari not only argue that the libido directly invests social
            relations without any mediation (such as introjection/projection, desexualization/
            sublimation, or symbolization), but that this investment is there from the start,
            at the level of the drives. One of the most profound and far-reaching theses of
            Anti-Oedipus is that the libidinal economy of Freud and the political economy of
            Marx are one and the same economy (“affects or drives form part of the infra-
            structure itself” [AO 53]), even if they have different regimes. The concept of the
            assemblage is itself derived from this insight. It is not through a desexualizing
            extension that the libido invests sociopolitical relation; “on the contrary, it is
            through a restriction, a blockage, and a reduction that the libido is made to
            repress its flows in order to contain them in the narrow cells of the type ‘couple,’
            ‘family,’ ‘person,’ ‘objects’” (293). In effect, this thesis is the basis of the political
            philosophy Deleuze begins to develop in Anti-Oedipus and continues in A Thou-
            sand Plateaus, although ZHizhek seems largely oblivious to it. Hence, it is difficult to
            know what ZHizhek means when he characterizes Deleuze as “the ideologist of late
            capitalism” (184), since he says nothing of either Deleuze’s analysis of capitalism
            or his critique of the concept of ideology.
                 These points, to be sure, hardly constitute a reading of Anti-Oedipus, one of
            Deleuze’s most difficult and ambitious texts, and can do little more than point
            toward the direction of future work. But what is striking about Anti-Oedipus is the
            degree to which Deleuze and Guattari fully admit their indebtedness to Lacan
            and describe their project as an attempt to take Lacan’s profound thought to its
            differential and immanent conclusion. As Deleuze explained:

                 Félix had talked to me about what he was already calling “desiring-
                 machines”: he had a whole theoretical and practical conception of the
                 unconscious as a machine, of the schizophrenic unconscious. So I
                 myself thought he had gone further than I had. But for all his uncon-
                 scious machinery, he was still talking in terms of structures, signifiers,
                 the phallus, and so on. That was hardly surprising, since he owed so
                 much to Lacan (just as I did). But I felt it would all work even better if
                 one found the right concepts, instead of using notions that didn’t even
                 come from Lacan’s creative side, but from an orthodoxy built up around
                 him. Lacan himself says, “I’m not getting much help.” We thought we’d
                 give him some schizophrenic help. And there’s no question that we’re
040   smith/46.4 (633-650)        9/15/05      11:29 AM      Page 648




            648                                 Daniel W. Smith
                  all the more indebted to Lacan, once we’ve dropped notions like struc-
                  ture, the symbolic, or the signifier, which are thoroughly misguided
                  [mauvaises], and which Lacan himself has always managed to turn on their
                  head in order to show their inverse side.25
            In this sense, Deleuze can be seen as one of Lacan’s most profound, but also most
            independent, disciples, inventing a whole new set of concepts to describe the
            inverse side of the symbolic structure. He followed a completely different path
            than the other disciples, such as Jacques-Alain Miller, the keeper of orthodoxy;
            Alain Badiou, who gives an axiomatic treatment of the symbolic; or ZHizhek him-
            self, the Lacanian reader of contemporary culture. The admiration Lacan and
            Deleuze had for each other’s work was obviously deep and full of respect. Deleuze
            once wrote: “My ideal, when I write about an author, would be to write nothing
            that could cause him sadness,” and this was no doubt true of his treatment of
            Lacan in Anti-Oedipus.26 In return, Lacan once said of a book critical of his work,
            “I have never been so well read—with so much love,” and one can almost imag-
            ine him making the same remark of Anti-Oedipus.27 Perhaps one day, someone
            with the competence and patience will provide us with a more complete reading
            of the way in which Deleuze took up and developed Lacan’s thought—and per-
            haps the way in which Lacan took up and develops Deleuze’s insights in his later
            work. ZHizhek, unfortunately, is not that person. Organs without Bodies: Deleuze and
            Consequences is a fascinating romp through the ZHizhekian universe, full of pene-
            trating insights and illuminating jokes, but as a reading of Deleuze it adds little to
            our understanding. The best place we have to go, still, for a Lacanian apprecia-
            tion of Deleuze is not ZHizhek, but rather . . . Lacan himself.

            17. Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, 26–27. At one point, Deleuze and Guattari
                describe the project of Anti-Oedipus in explicitly Kantian terms: “In what he termed
                the critical revolution, Kant intended to discover criteria immanent to understanding
                so as to distinguish the legitimate and the illegitimate uses of the syntheses of con-
                sciousness. In the name of transcendental philosophy (immanence of criteria), he
                therefore denounced the transcendent use of the syntheses such as appeared in meta-
                physics. In a like fashion, we are compelled to say that psychoanalysis has its meta-
                physics—its name is Oedipus. And that a revolution—this time materialist—can
                proceed only by way of a critique of Oedipus, by denouncing the illegitimate use of
                the syntheses of the unconscious as found in Oedipal psychoanalysis, so as to redis-
                cover a transcendental unconscious defined by the immanence of its criteria, and a
                corresponding practice that we shall call schizoanalysis” (75).

                seen that, in Lacan, the hypothesis of an unconscious-as-language does not closet the
                unconscious in a linguistic structure, but leads linguistics to the point of its auto-
                critique, by showing how the structural organization of signifiers still depends on a
                despotic Great Signifier acting as an archaism.”

            20. In Logic of Sense, the distinction between surface and depth is paralleled in the differ-
                ence between Lewis Carroll (surface) and Antonin Artaud (depth), but Deleuze’s pref-
                erence for Artaud and the dimension of depth (rather than surface) is already evident:
                “We would not give a page of Artaud for all of Carroll. Artaud is alone in having been
                an absolute depth in literature, and in having discovered a vital body and the prodi-
                gious language of this body” (93).
            21. Judith Butler, for instance, characterizes Deleuze and Guattari’s conception of desire
                as “an originary unrepressed libidinal diversity subject to the prohibitive laws of cul-
                ture,” an ahistorical or “pre-cultural ideal” à la Rousseau or Montesquieu, a “natural
                eros which has subsequently been denied by a restrictive culture,” arguing that
                Deleuze and Guattari promise “a liberation of that more original, bounteous desire.”
                See Judith Butler, Subjects of Desire (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999),
                214–15, 206. ZHizhek, happily, does not fall into this trap.

Denialism




             Perhaps the most coherent expression of Presi-
             dent Thabo Mbeki’s position on the relation-
             ship between HIV, AIDS, and antiretroviral
             (ARV) therapy is set forth in a document
             entitled ‘‘Castro Hlongwane, Caravans, Cats,
             Geese, Foot and Mouth Statistics: HIV/AIDS
             and the Struggle for the Humanisation of the
             African.’’ The text was distributed throughout
             the African National Congress (ANC) National
             Executive in March 2002, and is rumored to
             have been authored by Peter Mokaba, whose
             subsequent death on June 9, 2002, at age
             forty-three of ‘‘acute pneumonia linked to a res-
             piratory problem’’ gave rise to speculations that
             he died of AIDS. It is not a document to be
             written oﬀ, even though this is how its critics
             have treated it.1 On the contrary, whether one
             interprets it as Mokaba’s oblique, extended sui-
             cide note (explaining why he would not take
             ARVs even though he could aﬀord them) or
             as Mbeki’s unwilling political last will and tes-
             tament (allowing a name to be given to his
             disavowal of a deadly condition’s given name),
             it must be read as a distinctly necropolitical
             text. In it we ﬁnd the strongest sustained argu-
             ment in support of the Mbeki administration’s

decision to delay the provision of ARVs to South Africans between 1999 and
2003. This argument may be summarized as follows: HIV is not the only
cause of the many immune deﬁciencies weakening the South African body
politic; poverty also causes the acquisition of immune deﬁciencies; the sci-
ence grounding HIV’s existence and treatment is not only questionable but
racist; ARVs can neither prevent nor treat the acquisition of poverty-based
immune deﬁciencies; ARVs are linked to the interests of multinational capi-
tal; ARVs are not even a cure for HIV and are toxic besides.2 Whatever the
merits of these claims are on their own terms (the racism of HIV/AIDS
epidemiology certainly has been well documented), ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’
adds them up, by a kind of kettle logic, to reach what seems to have been a
presupposed conclusion: the Ministry of Health need not rush to include
ARV treatments as a part of the ﬁght against HIV/AIDS in South Africa.
The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) estimates that this conclusion has
led to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of poor people.
   It is tempting to read ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’ as a mere eﬀect of a more
fundamental economic logic, such that the Mbeki administration’s hesita-
tion to provide ARVs could be explained because they are too expensive, or
because providing generic ARVs would somehow scare oﬀ foreign direct
investment. But the disturbing probability is that the Mbeki administra-
tion’s theories about HIV and AIDS operate with a high degree of rela-
tive autonomy. Providing ARVs for HIV-positive South Africans is not only
economically possible for the Mbeki administration, but may be its most
cost-eﬀective policy option.3 The decision not to provide ARVs cannot then
be considered a decision made of economic necessity. As Mandisa Mbali
argues, the very opposite is true: there is every indication that the theory that
HIV is not the exclusive cause of AIDS is the exclusive cause of the Mbeki
administration’s deadly delay of ARVS.4 ‘‘Castro Hlongwane,’’ as the single
most coherent formulation of this theory, must be read for the performative
force of its death sentences.


The dominant accounts of the Mbeki administration’s denialism tend to
frame the question as a variation on the tradition of humanistic and social-
scientiﬁc thought Mahmood Mamdani has called ‘‘South African exception-
alism.’’ 5 Grasped within this frame, Mbeki’s theories would be unique to
South Africa, intelligible as only another intriguing turn in the history of a
particularly fascinating nation, the politics and culture of which are unlike
any other. The corollary of this approach would be the reduction of denial-
                                                                 Denialism   771



ism to an exceptionalism of a second sort. As the only leader in contempo-
rary world politics to publicly question accepted scientiﬁc opinion on the
question of HIV/AIDS, Mbeki would appear purely and simply irrational.
He would emerge as the embodiment of every postulate of Enlightenment
racism.
   Aside from its capitulation to the eternal imperialist suspicion of post-
colonial self-government, the problem with the exceptionalist approach is
that it would obscure a more general economy of denialism, a denialism writ
large. By this, I mean the denialism programmed into not only the circuits
and institutions of globalizing capital, but also the U.S. mass media’s apoca-
lyptic accounts of AIDS in Africa that have circulated since at least 1986.6
Discussing these accounts in 1988, Susan Sontag objected to the ‘‘prolif-
eration of reports or projections of unreal (that is, ungraspable) dooms-
day eventualities,’’ arguing that the narrative of inevitability structuring the
latter is bound ‘‘to produce a variety of reality-denying responses.’’ 7 On Son-
tag’s read, there is a denialist kernel lodged in the very discourse of emer-
gency that has framed the northern approach to the pandemic from the
beginning. To the extent that Africa already signiﬁed nihilism (death, sick-
ness, nothingness, despair) in and for the Euro-American social imaginary,8
it cannot come as a surprise that the subjects of the same would prefer
merely to shudder at the thought of Africans’ lack of access to essential
medicines (for HIV/AIDS or for malaria or tuberculosis). In South Africa,
meanwhile, the earliest accounts of the epidemic emerged in 1983.9 In the
next eight years, more than ﬁfty studies would be published in South Africa
in the ﬁelds of actuarial science, epidemiology, business management,
demography, and public health.10 These studies, many of which were con-
ducted in the ministries of the apartheid state, the labs, libraries, and
archives of white-only universities, and the oﬃces of white-owned capitals,
openly calculated and speculated on the eﬀect of HIV on South Africa’s
black population.11 By 1989, the same apartheid ministers who, in 1985, had
rebuked a sensationalist media for blowing the epidemic out of proportion 12
were musing publicly about the disease’s destructive power.13 Between
1990 and 1995, hundreds more studies of HIV/AIDS in South Africa
emerged.14 The methodologies, disciplinary status, institutional supports,
and problématique of these studies were more or less the same as the studies
of the late 1980s, but they were now marked by one critical diﬀerence. By
the late 1980s to mid-1990s, the discourse on HIV/AIDS, in South Africa
as elsewhere,15 had been altered by the emergence of ‘‘miracle drugs.’’ After
the FDA approved Zidovudine (AZT) in 1987, it was clear that the medi-
772 Adam Sitze



cation, while toxic and by no means a cure for HIV/AIDS, could signiﬁ-
cantly inhibit the replication of HIV, and that people with low white blood
cell counts could—like Lazarus, it was said—return from the grave.16 By
early 1994, further studies established that AZT could reduce mother-to-
child-transmission (MTCT) of HIV to as low as 8.3 percent.17 A second
HIV/AIDS drug, Didanosine (ddI), would be approved by the FDA in Octo-
ber 1991, while Nevirapine, which the FDA approved in September 1996,
was shown in 1999 to be 50 percent more powerful than AZT in reducing
intrapartum MCTC.
   What this means is that even prior to the emergence between 1994 and
1996 of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors,
and powerful ‘‘triple therapies,’’ knowledge about the horrible scope of the
pandemic had been multiplied by a decisive coeﬃcient. For at least a decade,
it has been possible to block the replication of the virus with antiretro-
viral treatment. In Foucauldian terms, biomedical technologies like AZT
and ddI brought a new diagram of power/knowledge into eﬀect.18 Because
ARVs reduced AIDS-related mortality by 75 percent, an HIV-positive diag-
nosis could be reclassiﬁed as a chronic condition rather than a death sen-
tence. This irreversibly changed the percepts that enable us to see and speak
about the virus. The new diagram introduced a set of urgent political ques-
tions related to the power relations of access. Now that life with HIV/AIDS
could be extended with regular doses of ARVs, corporate entities entered
into direct relations of biopolitical regulation of the bodies of people with
HIV/AIDS. Even as people with HIV/AIDS acquired a new form of life,
the laws of the deregulated market acquired a new power to live and let
die. In 1989, an emergent AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP),
which was largely responsible for constituting the new diagram in the ﬁrst
place,19 placed political economic questions regarding the cost and distri-
bution of ARVs at the very center of the struggle against the pandemic.20
The major pharmaceutical corporations acknowledged as much by enter-
taining questions of the global aﬀordability of ARVs in a set of meetings
hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) between 1991 and 1993.21
Claiming to be at the mercy of the same laws of capital they mercilessly
enforced, these corporations raised those questions in convoluted terms
that permitted them to be immediately dropped. And so, more than ten
years after AZT was approved by the FDA as a treatment for HIV/AIDS,
researchers in Geneva could still report, writing in an evasive passive voice,
that ‘‘unfortunately, the biomedical advance demonstrating the dramatic
                                                               Denialism   773



reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV with Zidovudine (ZDV)
treatment has yet to be translated into widespread use of antiviral treatment
to help prevent HIV infection in infants.’’ 22


Indeed, to inquire into denialism today is to ask how ‘‘only a fraction of
those in need were receiving antiretroviral treatment at the end of 2002—
about 800,000 people worldwide, 500,000 of whom live in high-income
countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 2.4 million died of AIDS in 2002,
only about 50,000 people were receiving treatment.’’ 23 It is impossible to
respond to this question without ﬁrst charting the ways that a certain denial-
ism has informed not only northern discourses on the pandemic, but also
the decisions of the dominant institutions of globalizing capital, which have
acted precisely to refuse the biopower called into being by the new biomedi-
cal technologies on the basis of a fundamentally racist approach to global
populations.24 In the same year that apartheid formally ended in Pretoria,
the groundwork for what some have called ‘‘global apartheid’’ was ﬁnalized
in Washington, D.C.25 In 1994, the year that studies deﬁnitively established
the power of perinatal AZT treatment, the best available projections warned
that the pandemic could soon double in size in the world’s poorest regions.26
Yet in that same year, the United States not only entered into a four-year
period of stagnant international HIV/AIDS funding,27 but also accelerated
its distinctly imperial economic policy by concluding the Uruguay round
of the General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade (GATT).28 The Final Act of
GATT established the World Trade Organization (WTO) and codiﬁed a set
of highly contested clauses pertaining to Trade-Related Aspects of Intel-
lectual Property Rights (TRIPs).29 The TRIPs clauses, formulated in large
part by multinational pharmaceutical corporations,30 gave the same cor-
porations signiﬁcant powers to secure their intellectual property patents,
and thus their monopolies, on essential medications.31 At a moment when
eﬀective HIV/AIDS treatments had been available for years, and when the
scope of the pandemic was plainly known to all decision makers, the United
States and Big Pharma acted not to support people with HIV/AIDS in their
struggle against the virus, but to protect patents from the claims of people
with HIV/AIDS. Not to be outdone where cruel mismanagement is con-
cerned, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), acting
with their signature incompetence,32 responded to HIV/AIDS not only by
adding fuel to the ﬁre, but also, during the late 1990s, by accusing Afri-
774 Adam Sitze



cans of arson. As scores of analysts have shown, it is no accident that the
states which implemented structural adjustment plans in the 1980s were
the same ones that found themselves most unable to respond eﬀectively to
the spread of HIV/AIDS in the 1990s.33 Forced to cut social spending and
even urged to charge for health care services in IMF-designed plans to sta-
bilize currencies and facilitate WB debt repayment, these states and their
diminished health care systems were incapable of addressing the mani-
fold medical needs of people living with HIV/AIDS.34 It was thus adding
insult to injury when, after years of creating this incapacity as a reality, the
World Bank issued a 1996 study regretfully conﬁrming the unaﬀordability
of HIV/AIDS treatment in sub-Saharan Africa on the basis of a ‘‘realistic
estimate’’ of the region’s low total health expenditure rates.35
    The cost-beneﬁt analyses by which these institutions arrived at their deci-
sions are, as David Fidler has argued, intelligible as a mix of vicious racism
and cynical Realpolitik.36 But what Fidler’s dialectic misses is the univer-
sal equivalent that renders the heat of the one commensurable with the
coldness of the other. It is neither hyperbole nor catachresis but arithmetic
to hear in these institutions’ murmured solipsistic calculations so many
hissed whispers of Marx’s blunt word on the fate of life abandoned by the
replication of surplus value: ‘‘The surplus populations would have to die.’’ 37
‘‘It is our view that the impact of AIDS via these mechanisms [labor supply
shortages and signiﬁcant reductions in aggregate demand (via reductions
in total consumption)] has been exaggerated in both cases. As we argued
earlier, in the presence of high unemployment, even the large numbers
of deaths from AIDS that our model projects are likely to result in tem-
porary labour supply bottlenecks and frictional replacement costs, rather
than substantial and lasting labour supply shortages.’’ 38 ‘‘In the presence
of large-scale unemployment, it is likely that a signiﬁcant proportion of
those disabled by, or dying from, HIV/AIDS will be replaced. The [indirect
costs] model [of the human capital approach, which ‘takes lost earnings as
a proxy for lost production attributable to the disease’] thus adjusts esti-
mates of total production downwards to account for the replacement of a
proportion of lost workers in these sectors. Note that non-marketed pro-
duction (such as household work) has not been included in the calculation
of lost production costs.’’ 39 ‘‘Over the short term at the macro level, and to
some extent determined by the nature of the economic groups aﬀected [by
HIV/AIDS], the indicators suggest that the economy as a whole may bene-
ﬁt, even while a range of households are forced ever further into a state
                                                                  Denialism   775



of unsustainability and poverty.’’ 40 ‘‘If the only eﬀect of the AIDS epidemic
were to reduce the population growth rate, it would increase the growth rate
of per capita income in any plausible economic model.’’ 41 ‘‘Dean Jamison of
the World Bank introduced the concept of a ‘disability-adjusted life year,’ or
DALY, to measure the number of productive years lost to illness or death.
By his calculus, for example, a country that spent $1,000 a year to save the
life of someone earning $500 a year would suﬀer a net economic loss.’’ 42 ‘‘It
is helpful, even crucial, to calculate the cost of disease and the resultant loss
of earnings. Health is clearly a factor in development. Bismarck knew that
in the late 19th century. He was the ﬁrst to persuade management to cre-
ate a mutual health insurance system for workers so the factories could go
on running. But it is naive to think that business people will be persuaded
to invest in healthcare in a globalised labor market.’’ 43 ‘‘I think to provide
treatment to the bulk of the people is just not feasible. I think to provide
treatment for instance to qualiﬁed workers actually saves money for com-
panies. . . . I think [of ] the cost of providing actual treatment to everyone at
the present. I don’t think it’s realistic. It’s not achievable.’’ 44
   Because capital is constrained only ever to be able to approach ARV treat-
ments, not to mention people with HIV/AIDS, on the basis of an M-C-M
circuit,45 the degree to which a chemical compound or a living being cannot
generate surplus value for capital is the degree to which it becomes super-
ﬂuous in and to a capitalist economy. Though the HIV/AIDS pandemic is
hardly reducible to the old laws of capital, capital’s contradictions neverthe-
less determine its shape and scope. As of 2000, ‘‘92 percent of the world
population have to make do with only 8 percent of total expenditure [on
ARV treatments].’’ 46 The dizzying interconnections of globalism’s parochial
ﬂows thus correlate with a striation of sobering global proportions: the loca-
tions of the markets where the most HIV/AIDS treatments are sold are
almost mutually exclusive with the places where most people with HIV/
AIDS live. Despite appearances, this is not so much a ‘‘market failure’’ 47
as a distinctly neoliberal overextension of the law of the market itself.48 By
insisting that it derive a surplus from the production of ARV treatments,
capital prevents the intrinsic capacities of the chemical compounds in those
treatments from doing what they can do in the bodies of people living with
HIV/AIDS. To the extent that essential medicines cannot generate capital,
capital renders them inessential, withholding them from the vast majority
of the people they are designed to treat. Conversely, by refusing to commit
to the health of people living with HIV/AIDS unless those people satisfy
776 Adam Sitze



a condition extraneous to health (the capacity to produce surplus value),
capital separates people with HIV/AIDS from what they could do with ARV
treatments. In short, by introducing into a problem of global health the com-
pletely extrinsic criteria of surplus value, capital separates individuals from
the inorganic nature they cannot live without.49
   Yet because the chemical compounds in ARV treatments are one of the
forms through which people create a life on the body-without-organs, those
compounds are not and cannot be the private property of this or that corpo-
ration, but are and must remain the products of what Marx calls the ‘‘general
intellect.’’ 50 The common notion that access to essential medicines is constitu-
tive of a life expresses ontologically what activist intellectuals express politi-
cally when they argue that ‘‘essential drugs must be considered a global pub-
lic good.’’ 51 More so than a call to return to the violated innocence of the
commons (which, despite its attractions, has its own problems 52), a com-
mon notion of this type opens up the practical generality, which is not to say
universality, adequate for reregulating, if not also dechartering, the corpora-
tions that are the worst enemies of the intrinsically generic compounds they
commodify. Patrick Bond is correct to call the struggle against HIV/AIDS a
confrontation with capital-in-general,53 as was Leslie Doyal when she argued
that ‘‘the demand for health is in itself a revolutionary demand,’’ 54 and the
late Jonathan Mann, who proposed that the struggle against HIV/AIDS is
by deﬁnition revolutionary.55 Loss of life from HIV/AIDS is less a structural
asymptote beyond which capital accumulation cannot occur 56 than a symp-
tom of a globalism already ready to absorb just such a loss.57 The compul-
sion to deny essential medicines to the poor is programmed into the circuits
by which globalizing capital attempts to reproduce its own constant rate of
growth. Multiplying capital cannot but multiply the virus.


How, if at all, does this help us read ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’? No doubt the
text’s arguments about poverty would not be so misleading were they lim-
ited to the claim that the spread of HIV/AIDS cannot be understood apart
from the conditions of extreme poverty that are one of the legacies of apart-
heid. This claim is all too true, and Zackie Achmat, chairperson of the
TAC, makes it frequently.58 All the same, it is pointless to draw on the tra-
ditional terms of philosophical logic to critique the sophistry of ‘‘Castro
Hlongwane.’’ Even focusing on its confused substitution of the pandemic’s
necessary condition (poverty) for its suﬃcient condition (HIV) distracts
                                                                 Denialism   777



from the fundamental problem. More than the market’s failure to ensure
the poor access to ARVs, denialism writ large describes a condition deﬁned
by the immanence of HIV/AIDS and capital. In the general economy we are
charting, the replication of deregulated capital and the unblocked replica-
tion of the virus are so tightly linked that, in eﬀect, they constitute a single
double helix.59 Where capital ﬁnds that it can extract surplus value from a
body or molecule, there ARVs will block the reverse transcription of HIV
RNA in the DNA of T-cells. But where capital ﬁnds no commodities to con-
vert to surplus value, there the nucleic acid of the virus copies itself without
limit in the living cells of the body. Under conditions of capitalist political
economy, the intervals of one repeat themselves in direct inverse proportion
to the intervals of the other. What’s more, as two of the most fundamental
forces deﬁning the diagram that today goes by the name globalization, and
as forces that are by deﬁnition neither dead nor alive, HIV/AIDS and global-
izing capital generate a situation in which the ontological limit between
life and death becomes more diﬃcult than ever to ﬁx. Marx established
long ago that capital is, as dead labor time, a nonliving yet undead force
that requires laboring beings for its own reproduction.60 Medical research-
ers, meanwhile, approach the HIV virus as a complex molecular (inorganic)
structure the only speciﬁcally organic characteristic of which—reproduc-
tion—it borrows parasitically from the enzymes, energy, and ribosomes of
its host cells.61 Given the structural similarity between these two circuits,
ought we consider the relation between them a mere matter of homology?
Or does their relation indicate that they exist on the same plane of consis-
tency and pursue a single global program? If so, how are we to understand
that plane, given that the striated disciplines that today remain in charge
of the study of the virus (macroeconomics, epidemiology, and virology, not
to mention actuarial science, business management, and demography) are
incapable of posing the question of their immanence? If both circuits deter-
mine the shape, extent, and quality of what we call globalization, won’t they
each also intensify the other’s rendering indistinct of the limit between life
and death? If so, how might that indistinction require us to rethink the
series of political, legal, moral, and epistemological concepts founded on
that limit? 62
   Before responding to these questions, let me consider the strongest
counterargument against the immanence of HIV/AIDS and global capital,
namely, that the latter is suﬃciently elastic to allow the former to disappear
without also altering its own fundamental structure. For the strongest proof
778 Adam Sitze



that deregulated capital cannot help but not help poor people with HIV/
AIDS, we unfortunately need look no further than capital’s own attempts at
largesse. Prior to the emergence of Bush’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR), capital’s best eﬀort to address the pandemic on its own terms
came in the form of a series of ‘‘price cuts.’’
     The most important agreement of recent years to reduce the cost of
     antiretrovirals in developing countries, the accelerating access initia-
     tive, has made it possible to cut the annual cost per patient from
     $12,000 in 2000 to $420 in 2003. It was launched in May 2000 by
     UNAIDS, in partnership with several UN agencies and ﬁve drug com-
     panies (Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, GlaxoSmith-
     Kline, Merck & Co., and Hoﬀmann-La Roche), but there is little to show
     for it. Over three years, 80 countries expressed interest; 39 have devel-
     oped action plans, but less than half have ﬁnally concluded agreements
     with the companies, and under 1% of the patients in those countries
     are receiving antiretroviral treatments: a total of 27,000 people beneﬁt
     in Africa where 30 million people are HIV+.63
Even though these price cuts had, as an unintended side-eﬀect, boomer-
anging calls for lower drug prices in G8 states,64 they nevertheless failed as
an attempt to break with capital’s laws of restricted economy. Like the chari-
table donations of major philanthropists, they arrived wrapped in restric-
tions and bound with ‘‘conditionalities.’’ 65 Hence Dr. Mohammed Abdul-
lah’s (chair of Kenya’s AIDS Control Council) riposte to the UNAIDS oﬀer:
‘‘If the international maﬁa—the drug companies—really mean business,
they should waive their patent rights and let developing countries make the
drugs themselves under their supervision. Kenya already has the capacity
to make most of these drugs. It is the big ﬁve who are stopping us.’’ 66 Bush’s
PEPFAR, which, like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria (GFATM),67 was forced into existence by the tireless eﬀorts of AIDS
activists, nevertheless does not break with this system of cynical subsidies
but, on the contrary, institutionalizes it.68 Even though Bush’s speechwrit-
ers included in his 2003 State of the Union address an unusually candid
remark regarding the ‘‘immense possibility’’ oﬀered by generic HIV/AIDS
treatments, PEPFAR’s only notable achievement since then has been how
quickly it has thrown the immense powers of the U.S. executive branch
behind Big Pharma’s suppression of that very possibility.69
  Neoliberalism’s abandonment of sub-Saharan Africa is all the more an-
                                                               Denialism   779



gering because of the signiﬁcant gains against HIV/AIDS accomplished by
the few states that have been able to decommodify HIV/AIDS treatments.
In 1996, drawing on a long history of opposition to drug patents,70 Brazil
passed its Patent Property Law, which allowed the Brazilian Health Minis-
try to combine prevention eﬀorts with universal and free access to locally
produced generic ARVs. The results were good. The virus’s transmission
rate was reduced, Brazil’s AIDS-related deaths were halved, and the gen-
eral state of public health improved.71 Pharmaceutical Executive magazine
dutifully warned its readers.72 And so, even though Brazil’s law was con-
sistent with TRIPs,73 which fully allows for compulsory licensing, because
of what one legal scholar generously calls ‘‘rampant confusion’’ over TRIPs
in the Oﬃce of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR),74 which has consis-
tently and aggressively misinterpreted TRIPs as a merely minimum stan-
dard for patent compliance,75 Brazil’s trade law was opposed ﬁrst by the
Clinton administration, which ﬁled formal complaints against the law with
the WTO on January 19, 2001, and then by the Bush administration, which
reﬁled the same complaint two weeks later.76
   But even with the threat of U.S. trade sanctions added into the equa-
tion, Brazil’s example demonstrated the possibility and desirability of break-
ing patents in order to implement a coordinated program of ARV treat-
ment and prevention. It was to emulate the successes of the Brazilian model
that the Mandela administration drafted the Medicines and Related Sub-
stances Control Amendment Act, Number 90, of 1997. The bill gave the
South African government the power to eliminate patent protections for
pharmaceuticals in order to reduce the price of medicines vital to pub-
lic health.77 Its section 15(c) vested the executive branch, via the minister
of health, with the power to compulsorily license HIV/AIDS medications
and/or to parallel import the same.78 Yet even though this ‘‘quite mild’’
law (as Jonathan King rightly characterized it 79) was completely TRIPs-
compliant, the United States threatened South Africa just as it had threat-
ened not only Brazil but also, earlier, Thailand.80 The United States placed
South Africa on its Special 301 watch list in 1998 and again in 1999. It ini-
tiated what the USTR explicitly called a ‘‘full court press,’’ even deploying
the personal charms of then vice president Al Gore to strike down the law.81
This ‘‘massive bullying eﬀort,’’ as Robert Weissman aptly renamed it, met
in April 1999 with sustained resistance organized and led by ACT UP activ-
ists like Paul Davis, Asia Russell, and Sharonann Lynch, supported by pub-
lic relations eﬀorts from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and informed
780 Adam Sitze



by research from the Consumer Project on Technology.82 Though many
altermondialistes cite Seattle as the ﬁrst signiﬁcant victory over the osten-
sibly anonymous and abstract forces of multinational capital, we must not
forget that, two months earlier, seven hundred motivated and highly orga-
nized people forced the USTR to announce, against a supposedly invin-
cible Big Pharma lobby, that ‘‘the trade dispute was resolved and that the
U.S. government would cease pressuring South Africa on the issues of com-
pulsory licensing and parallel imports.’’ 83 This victory obviously worried
PhRMA, which, besides being impatient with the impotence of the U.S.
executive branch, was nervous about the combination of intensifying treat-
ment access activism in South Africa and the oﬀer of inexpensive generic
ARVs by a number of Thai and Indian pharmaceuticals.84 Along with its
twin organization in South Africa (the South African Pharmaceutical Manu-
facturers’ Association [PMA]), PhRMA ﬁled suit against the South African
government in 1999, naming Mandela as a defendant in an attempt to strike
section 15(c) from the books. What happened next is diﬃcult to forget, if
only because its force as an event is still resonating today. On April 19, 2001,
thirty-nine of the richest pharmaceutical companies, acting as a cartel of
the single-most proﬁtable sector of multinational capital in the world, with-
drew their case against South Africa, having been outmaneuvered in and
out of court by the South African government, the TAC, and the bright-red
protest of the global multitude.


What this cursory chart indicates is that what today goes by the name denial-
ism is not and cannot be limited either to Mbeki or even to a text like ‘‘Castro
Hlongwane.’’ On the contrary, after turning a cold hard stare toward the
problem of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in the late 1980s and early
1990s, the dominant institutions of international ﬁnance, multinational
capital, global governance, and developed states, up to and including the
U.S. executive branch, refused sub-Saharan Africa access to the potent com-
bination of generic medicines and capital necessary to stall the epidemic.
The emergence of this general economy of denialism is both datable and
demonstrable. It is datable because the potentialities it suppressed emerged
at a very speciﬁc conjuncture deﬁned by the emergence of ARV therapies.
It is demonstrable because it is based on an easily reconstructed set of cost-
beneﬁt calculations that continue to be shamelessly computed in public
today. And it is general because it marked an abyssal consensus reached by
                                                                    Denialism   781



globalism’s leading institutions. Because global capital would not suﬀer the
expenditure necessary to halt the replication of the virus, the replication of
the virus could not be halted. People with HIV/AIDS would just have to
suﬀer.85
   To propose the existence of a ‘‘denialism writ large’’ or a ‘‘general econ-
omy of denialism’’ is neither merely to return the insult nor to exonerate the
Mbeki administration. It is to suggest that a quotient of the force enabling
the scornful critique of the Mbeki administration in northern mass media
derives from a condensation and displacement of denialism writ large onto
Mbeki’s ﬁgure. Readers of Time and Newsweek can sleep well at night know-
ing that irrational African leaders (and not the multinationals whose adver-
tisements cram those same magazine’s pages) are responsible for withhold-
ing HIV/AIDS treatments from the poor. Our nominalism requires us to
understand this denialism of the ﬁrst order. But that same principle obliges
us to acknowledge that denial is more than a mere refusal of reality. In addi-
tion to naming a psychic symptom and an epistemological error, the term
also indicates a very speciﬁc relation of power. When we critique the way
a government denies a person his or her rights, we imply that it refuses a
person what is already essentially constitutive of his or her very being: the
right to have rights.86 It is this doxa that is at issue when, in the ﬁrst volume
of The History of Sexuality, Foucault suggested that the exercise of contem-
porary sovereign power was no longer a power ‘‘to take life or let live’’ but
a power ‘‘to make live or to cast out into death [de rejeter dans la mort].’’ 87
Hurley’s translation of rejeter as ‘‘disallow’’ obscures the sense in which the
sovereign power to let die manifests itself precisely as a kind of ‘‘repudia-
tion.’’ Under political conditions that place the subject’s ‘‘existence as a living
being in question,’’ 88 sovereign power is what it was for Sade: a power to
repudiate zoe itself.89 Whatever is refused in denial is immanent to the life
of the denied.
   This relation to institutions of sovereign power suggests that denialism
is not so much symptom or error as global dispositif.90 Understood in this
manner, denialism’s component parts deﬁnitely include a way of not see-
ing or not speaking about the potentialities of HIV/AIDS treatment (which
we may just as well call ‘‘disavowal’’). But beyond that, it consists of the sov-
ereign power to refuse to the living the forms-of-life without which a life
cannot be alive, and also, above all, of the relations of economic and political
force that enable disavowal to become a sovereign power capable of actualiz-
ing the potential superﬂuity of poor people living with HIV/AIDS. Denial-
782 Adam Sitze



ism will have been in eﬀect wherever a disavowal of the possibilities of life
with HIV/AIDS ﬁnds institutional support in the sovereign power to aban-
don naked life. Numerous embodiments of the U.S. executive branch,91 if
not also the executives of numerous African states,92 the various institu-
tions of the Washington Consensus, and the major pharmaceutical capitals
exercise a denialism of this type. A denialist institution is one whose bio-
political claim on life requires it constantly to attempt to register the colos-
sal reality of the HIV/AIDS pandemic (through ceaseless studies, shock-
ing estimates, grave public statements, expert panels, sustained public
relations campaigns, maudlin charity balls, half-hearted aid programs,
strange donation schemes) yet whose implication within circuits of capi-
tal spur it to disavow that same reality (mainly by classifying it as an ethi-
cal problem, which, as Alain Badiou has argued, has the eﬀect of ceding
to the market a monopoly over the ontological attribute of necessity: such
classiﬁcation already invites the active and passive suppression of exist-
ing but uneconomical possibilities for slowing the virus replication 93). The
most powerful eﬀect of such institutions is that those living within their
jurisdictions ﬁnd themselves internally excluded by the surfeit of overlap-
ping sovereign powers claiming to ensure their salus.94 Denialism’s crown-
ing achievement is an absurd but not unfamiliar geopolitical condition in
which the leading institutions of globalizing capital daily reiterate their
commitment to the ﬁght against HIV/AIDS—a geopolitical condition, then,
where people with HIV/AIDS have never attracted more compassionate
spokespeople, charitable organizations, concerned onlookers, professional
mourners, pitying philanthropists, and rock-star advocates—and yet where,
ﬁfteen years after ARVs emerged as a distinct biomedical possibility, they
are available to only 50,000 to 75,000 of the 4.1 million in sub-Saharan
Africa who will die without immediate access to them.


A perplexing contiguity links the general economy of denialism to its spe-
ciﬁc manifestation in the Mbeki administration. Approached in this frame,
Mbeki’s denialism is still, in Mamphela Ramphele’s words, ‘‘irresponsibility
bordering on criminality.’’ 95 Even before the South African government’s
and the TAC’s resounding April 2001 court victory over the pharmaceutical
cartel, the Ministry of Health indicated that it would not declare the situa-
tion a ‘‘national emergency’’ or ‘‘extreme urgency’’ that, under Article 31
of TRIPs would be the surest way to open an exception to patent enforce-
                                                                   Denialism   783



ment and enable the parallel imports the court victory had made possible.96
Instead, Mbeki began posing, more insistently and publicly than ever, ques-
tions he had asked since at least 1999 regarding the relationship between
HIV and AIDS, the validity of HIV/AIDS tests, the racist presuppositions
of epidemiological studies of HIV, and the ostensibly intolerable toxicity of
ARVs.97 Why?
    When the TAC calls the Mbeki administration’s logic ‘‘denialism,’’ or
when Pieter-Dirk Uys parodies Mbeki by playing ‘‘MacBeki,’’ they imply
that Mbeki’s position is informed by a certain madness.98 ‘‘Disavowal’’ (Ver-
leugnung) is certainly, for Freud, constituted by a simultaneous denial and
recognition of a traumatic reality that is so consistent it eventually splits
the ego into the two autonomous egos of the psychotic. But the textual
operation at work when ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’ rejects the relation between
HIV and AIDS through a semantic analysis of the signiﬁer AIDS itself,99
to the point where it argues that to call the illnesses sweeping through
South Africa ‘‘AIDS’’ would itself be genocide,100 suggests that, if there were
an operation of psychosis in ‘‘Castro Hlongwane,’’ it would not be intelli-
gible in Freudian terms. Because the text seems to encounter AIDS as an
inassimilable signiﬁer, and because its miracle cure for AIDS consists in
nothing more than a refusal of its signiﬁed, the madness of the text would
seem to consist less in disavowal than in what Lacan, drawing on a juridi-
cal term, calls ‘‘foreclosure.’’ 101 For Lacan, foreclosure takes place when the
subject’s refusal, rejection, or repudiation of le nom du père reaches a point
where the paternal signiﬁer is cast outside of the symbolic altogether. The
paradox of foreclosure is that the signiﬁer which confers order, identity,
and law upon the symbolic is forced outside of the same symbolic order it
grounds.102 It is for this reason that foreclosure manifests itself in a certain
kind of ‘‘miraculous’’ symbolic creativity.103 The hallucinations of the psy-
chotic, Lacan suggests, are speciﬁcally neological in character, marked by
autonyms, new compound words, purely homophonic equivalences, and a
struggle against the omnipotent words of God.104 On this read, if there were
in ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’ a certain operation of psychosis, it would manifest
itself at the point where the text renames the acronym AIDS and introduces
its mode of truth production as a ‘‘miracle’’ akin to a sovereign performative
(‘‘let there be light’’).105 Like President Schreber’s autobiography, the validity
of the text’s statements would derive from its attempt to occupy the gap in
the symbolic left open by the foreclosed-upon nom du père. But, keeping
in mind that for Achille Mbembe, as for Carl Schmitt, the category of the
784 Adam Sitze



miracle is linked to the paradox of the sovereign exception, where the sover-
eign is legally exempted from the same rule of law he grounds, perhaps we
ought to consider a less psychobiographical approach to the interpretation
of ‘‘Castro Hlongwane.’’ 106 From the angle of a certain concept of political
sovereignty, the text’s theories, which by its own account do battle with the
signiﬁers of an omnipotent apparatus, would be what Mbembe would call a
‘‘fantasm of power.’’ Issued from the organ of sovereign power, they would
be written with the tip of God’s phallus.107 In this event, it would be impos-
sible to read ‘‘Castro Hlongwane’’ without situating its theories in the non-
discursive supports that endow them with the capacity to remain in force
while also signifying nothing.108
    Whatever its etiology, Mbeki’s maddening intransigence forced the TAC
into action against the same post-apartheid government that many TAC ac-
tivists had fought to bring into existence.109 In August 2001, the TAC ﬁled
suit in the Transvaal High Court against the South African Ministry of
Health and against each of the provincial Executive Councils of Health,
demanding that Nevirapine be made available to HIV-positive pregnant
women giving birth in public health institutions, and that the government
implement an eﬀective national program to prevent MTCT of HIV. The
TAC won the case in December 2001, with the high court ruling that ‘‘the
state ban on Nevirapine outside pilot sites was ‘unjustiﬁable,’’’ 110 only to face
an immediate appeal by the Ministry of Health. At issue in the Ministry’s
appeal was a question concerning the balance of powers under the new Con-
stitution: by requiring the government to prevent MTCT, was the Constitu-
tional Court creating health policy (that is, overstepping its constitutional
limits) or merely enforcing the Bill of Rights? 111 It is worth dwelling on this
question for a moment. Given the ease with which the term apartheid lends
itself to metonymy, it is no surprise that the social antagonisms around
treatment access would quickly become narrated as a struggle against a new
apartheid. Though recourse to the term is by no means inappropriate, the
trouble with applying it straightforwardly to the ANC-led government is
that the rhetorical plus of a dramatic dialectical reversal does not oﬀset the
logical minuses of occluding the term’s contested historiography, obscur-
ing the care with which the TAC positions itself relative to the ANC and
to South Africa’s 1996 Constitution, and obfuscating the concrete way in
which the political legacy of apartheid is directly at stake in the political
techniques by which the TAC struggled for access. A more nuanced ver-
sion of the same argument would suggest that the TAC’s struggle against
                                                                  Denialism   785



the Mbeki administration is less reducible to a struggle against the ANC
per se, than against the enduring powers of the executive branch in particu-
lar.112 In 1991, Barney Pityana observed that, under apartheid, the principle
of parliamentary sovereignty had resulted in ‘‘the erosion of the power and
inﬂuence of the judiciary in favour of the executive.’’ 113 The judiciary’s impo-
tence under the Westminster system relegated it to the mere enforcement
of racist laws it could not and, in any case, often would not contest. Given the
extent to which minority white supremacist rule depended on unchecked
executive power, it makes sense that Pityana would conclude his argument
by suggesting that, among other things, ‘‘those who will work on a new con-
stitution need to ensure that there is a genuine separation of powers’’ and
‘‘that the power of the executive is limited.’’ 114
    In post-apartheid South Africa, the struggle to maintain the indepen-
dence of the judiciary has taken on a contradictory form, since, despite sig-
niﬁcant progress, the courts remain all but inaccessible to the poors, and
continue to be composed of many of the same white judges who presided
so fecklessly under apartheid.115 South Africa’s Constitutional Court, which
came into being on February 15, 1995, was designed to respond to, if not
also resolve, this contradiction. More than any other juridical-political insti-
tution created by the new Constitution, it was to serve as the foundation
for the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers that were to have deﬁned
the post-apartheid Rechtsstaat.116 The Court’s powers were to ensure that the
seat of sovereign power in post-apartheid South Africa would be concen-
trated more in the Constitution and in the judiciary than in the legislature
or executive. The strong argument on behalf of this approach is that it would
be able to provide a juridical-political framework capable of lawfully disman-
tling apartheid’s white supremacist legacy. Because the new Constitution’s
Bill of Rights included justiciable socioeconomic rights, and because the
executive branch remained responsible for the ﬁscal consequences of any
given national social and economic policy, the new Constitution’s separa-
tion of powers positioned the Constitutional Court to become a site where
the socioeconomic legacy of apartheid could be contested, as it were, at the
expense of the executive.117 Yet, by that same token, the introduction of the
new Constitution was less a hammer blow than a heart transplant: it did not
shatter apartheid in a single stroke but introduced an organ that, if success-
ful, would be capable eventually of circulating nonracialism in the capillar-
ies of the body politic. But herein lies one of the signature limits to the con-
stitutionalist approach to political transition. The trouble is not only that,
786 Adam Sitze



as Heinz Klug argues, ‘‘to date there have been very few constitutional chal-
lenges to the basic inequalities which are part of apartheid’s legacy,’’ but also
that, when it comes to the basic inequalities that are the legacy of apartheid,
‘‘it is not clear what a constitution can do.’’ 118
    The TAC’s legal challenges against the executive branch are one of the
ﬁrst signiﬁcant tests of the socioeconomic rights set forth in the Consti-
tution, as well as one of the ﬁrst signiﬁcant tests of the balance of powers
between the executive and the judiciary.119 As such, the TAC’s case is less
a renewal, sequel, or analog of the struggle to constitute a post-apartheid
South African state than a concrete and direct extension of that struggle.
Approached from this angle, where the separation of powers becomes intel-
ligible as a site for contestation over the political trace of apartheid, one of
the more disturbing aspects of Mbeki’s denialism emerges. As it prolonged
its denialism even after losing its Constitutional Court appeal in July 2002,
the Mbeki administration turned one of the foundational institutions of
the post-apartheid Constitution into a point where the same Constitution
founders. After the MTCT case, it seemed that the Mbeki administration
would begin to climb down from its denialism (not least because, that same
month, the Mbeki administration announced that it would also make ARVs
available to rape survivors). But it was precisely at that point that ‘‘Castro
Hlongwane’’ was leaked. Even the TAC’s court victories, which suggested
that justiciable socioeconomic rights are indeed practicable,120 were not suf-
ﬁcient to bring into existence the MTCT programs legitimated in them.
Denialism had been overruled in the Constitutional Court, but it was still
in eﬀect biopolitically. In December 2002, the executive’s delays forced the
TAC to lodge a complaint with South Africa’s Human Rights Council.121 The
complaint called for an investigation of contempt of court by the Mpuma-
langa MEC for Health, since the MTCT program supported by the highest
level of the South African judiciary had still not been implemented. In Janu-
ary 2003, Tshabala-Msimang again argued that ‘‘garlic, lemon, olive, and
African potatoes’’ could be used in place of ARVs to strengthen immune
systems, while also blocking a Global Fund disbursement of $72 million
intended to purchase ARVs in KwaZulu-Natal. In March 2003, frustrated by
the executive’s prolonged refusal, the TAC introduced another civil disobe-
dience campaign. When, after four years of patient civil rights organizing,
the TAC laid charges of murder and culpable homicide against members of
the ANC government, or when it interrupted the minister of health’s speech
                                                                  Denialism   787



to call her a murderer, their tactics were hardly, as some have charged, ‘‘out
of order’’ than perhaps long overdue.122


Besides suggesting that the powers of executoria potestas have managed to
persist in post-apartheid South Africa, Mbeki’s denialism has thus demon-
strated the fragility of even an extremely strong Rechtsstaat. When the basic
right at issue is the right for access to health care services, and when the
service in question consists of access to a chemical compound capable of
blocking HIV’s replication, the essence of a right is not, as commonsensi-
cal discourses of right presuppose, predicated of space (where the decisive
questions concern inclusion or exclusion, being inside or outside right’s
domain, staying within or straying beyond its limits). Where the exercise of
rights is deﬁned by an expiration date, it is time that is of the essence. The
Mbeki administration’s exercise of executive power following, and argu-
ably even prior to, the MTCT case opened a biotemporal exception to rights
within the space of rights itself.123 Denialism is an exercise of political power
in which the executive branch exercised a power to let die without also, at
the same time, revoking or suspending the constitutional provisions that
guarantee a right to life.
   Ulrike Kistner thus has a persuasive case when she applies to Mbeki’s
denialism Agamben’s analysis of the sovereign power and naked life.124 But,
by that same token, Kistner’s straightforward application of Agamben also
obscures the way that denialism throws the dominant reading of Agamben
into question. The Mbeki administration’s life-denying exercise of sover-
eign power consisted not in a declaration of a state of emergency, but, on the
contrary, in a stalwart refusal to issue such a declaration.125 By not declaring
the health emergency that only the executive branch, through the Ministry
of Health, could declare, Mbeki delayed triggering the TRIPs clause that
would have activated key provisions of Article 31 of the TRIPs agreement
and enabled the compulsory licensing of inexpensive versions of HIV/AIDS
therapies.126 Abandoned within the interval of these delays, those claim-
ing their right to life in an exemplary way—in a way that scrupulously and
explicitly aﬃrmed the basic rights set forth in the new Constitution—were
nevertheless unable to bring those rights to life. Before being able to see
the fruits of their labor in the TAC’s August 2003 victory, TAC activists
Queenie Qiza, Edward Mabunda, Christopher Moraka, and Charlene Wil-
788 Adam Sitze



son, to name just a few, succumbed to AIDS and died. Their deaths were
foreseeable, and could have been prevented had they had access to the thera-
pies they were fully within their rights to receive. But their right to life was
denied by the Mbeki administration’s sovereign refusal to exercise its own
sovereign power.
   It does not follow from this that those who died protesting their right to
life were victims of false consciousness, or that the TAC was duped by the
Constitution into limiting itself to merely legal tactics (the very opposite is
true), or that rights are not worth ﬁghting for, or that the state’s denial of
the basic right to life in this instance somehow cancels out the merits of
rights per se. The troubling implication of denialism is rather that necro-
political abandonment can take place even in a robust Rechtsstaat. Denial-
ism’s corollary, in this respect, is the urgency of posing biopolitical ques-
tions not merely in constitutionalist terms, where the possession of a right
is itself taken as a form of political power, but, more fundamentally, in terms
of the immanent modes of existence of people provided with rights. Where
the possession of right is neither coextensive with nor even determinant of
political power relations, the latter’s relation to life will become felicitous
or salutary less through the recitation of various bacis rights than through
reference to the twist or torsion that is both prior to and incommensurable
with the foundation of the constitution itself.127
   In these terms, the speciﬁcally political philosophical question posed by
denialism is not why Mbeki says what he says, whether he personally
believes in his own utterances or not, whether he really is mad or not, and
so on. It is how the post-apartheid state acquired the power to deny life and
to preserve rights in one and the same gesture. Here it is worth recalling
that the obscure and often bizarre writings of David Rasnick, Peter Dues-
berg, Robert Root-Bernstein, and others did not become life-denying until
their iterations entered into relation with the nondiscursive force speciﬁc to
the institution of potestas executoria.128 Mbeki’s ‘‘irresponsibility bordering
on criminality’’ is inseparable from the criminality of sovereignty itself.129
Yet if there is therefore no denialism without the sovereign power to let die,
so too is there no sovereign power to let die without its own scandalous
genealogy.130 What the contemporary critique of the Mbeki administration
too often misses is that a certain denialism deﬁned the apartheid state’s
relation to HIV/AIDS from the very beginning. In the early 1990s, a num-
ber of medical workers began arguing that the rapid spread of the epidemic
through various black populations was related to a datable and demon-
                                                                 Denialism   789



strable pattern of inaction on the part of the apartheid government since
1983.131 This inaction was especially egregious given the government’s fore-
knowledge of the possibility of epidemic.132 In as early as 1985, the Depart-
ment of National Health and Population Development established an AIDS
Advisory Group.133 For reasons of racism and homophobia,134 the few edu-
cational initiatives it did organize were limited to almost exclusively white
populations.135 Only in 1992, after conferring with the Health Secretariat
of the newly unbanned ANC,136 did the Department of Health establish a
national AIDS program.137 Writing in that year, Alan Fleming sharply cor-
rected the lament that South Africa had already lost the battle to prevent
AIDS. ‘‘I disagree: battle was never joined.’’ 138 A year later, Wilson Carswell
issued a damning critique outlining the deliberate nature of this inaction.
     South Africa has the infrastructure and health funding needed to check
     AIDS, but failed to take action. The central health ministry did not
     respond to the epidemic until 1990 with the establishment of an AIDS
     unit, secondary school AIDS prevention programs and packages in
     8 languages, a neutral national information campaign, workshops to
     increase awareness, and funding to organizations targeting hard-to-
     reach groups. The AIDS unit was soon merged into a health promo-
     tion section and the unit’s head ﬁred, with all the prevention initia-
     tives terminated except the continued availability of pamphlets in only
     English and Afrikaans. An oﬃcial complaint has been made to no avail
     against the health department oﬃcial who closed the AIDS campaign.
     Meanwhile, the government contends that it holds no responsibility
     for educating its population in the prevention of AIDS. These recent
     actions suggest that the government is committing genocide by allow-
     ing excess mortality from AIDS to decimate Black heterosexuals dur-
     ing the impending period of interim rule and political transition.139
Carswell’s argument is hardly a conspiracy theory. Writing in 1988, Susan
Sontag cited then foreign minister Roelof ‘‘Pik’’ Botha’s ominous warning
that ‘‘the terrorists are now coming to us with a weapon more terrible than
Marxism: AIDS.’’ 140 That the apartheid government reacted to HIV/AIDS
primarily as a tactic of warfare is clear from other sources as well. In 1999,
two former apartheid agents applied to the Truth and Reconciliation Com-
mission for amnesty for employing HIV-positive ex-PAC and ANC mem-
bers in 1990 to spread HIV/AIDs in black brothels.141 Yet even as unthink-
able as this act is, it is not an aberration from the crime that is apartheid
790 Adam Sitze



itself. Apartheid pursued genocide not only through the police’s weapon-
ization of people with HIV/AIDS, but also through the sham sovereignty of
the tribal homelands. Pieter-Dirk Uys misses the mark when he suggests
that ‘‘in the past the South African government killed people; now we
just let them die!’’ 142 One need only review the last half century’s black
infant mortality rates to see that Biko was not exaggerating when he argued
that ‘‘the tribal cocoons called ‘homelands’ are nothing else but sophisti-
cated concentration camps where black people are allowed to ‘suﬀer peace-
fully.’ ’’ 143 The sovereign power to let die was always integral to the necro-
politics of the apartheid state. That this power was not suﬃciently dissolved
with the transfer of power in 1994 is clear from the implementation of
the AIDS Plan the ANC developed in concert with the Department of
Health after its unbanning. Though the plan was progressive in many
respects, ﬁnal political authority for its coordination rested with the execu-
tive branch, where, despite considerable bureaucratic confusion in the
intervening years, is where it remains today.144 If, as Helen Schneider,
Joanne Stein, and Mandisa Mbali can argue, ‘‘the real problem underlying
AIDS implementation failure in South Africa’’ is the ‘‘authoritarian’’ style of
the political leaders coordinating that implementation, it is because of an
incomplete transformation of the sovereign powers that deﬁned the worst
of apartheid.145 Denialism is less a question of Mbeki’s utterances or
Mokaba’s psyche than matter of the nondiscursive forces speciﬁc to institu-
tions of executoria potestas. In the last analysis, it is against the remanence of
these forces that the TAC struggles. The fundamental political philosophi-
cal question posed by denialism is how a sovereign power to abandon naked
life to unceremonial death was able to survive South Africa’s transition to
democracy.


Posing the problem in this manner simultaneously opens a way to think
about the forms of resistance to denialism. In 2003, the leading institu-
tions of global mass media focused considerable attention on TAC chair-
person Zackie Achmat’s pledge not to take ARVs before they became avail-
able in the South African public health care system.146 Precisely because
of the hagiographic quality of this attention, which obscures the character
of the TAC as a broad grass-roots movement, it is has become necessary
to rethink Achmat’s interventions on the basis of his own writing. By the
latter, I mean to the texts Achmat has published on sex, politics, and rep-
                                                                 Denialism   791



resentation around the same time he founded the National Coalition for
Gay and Lesbian Equality. Even as the very best of the recent hagiographies
take pains to include mentions of Achmat’s six months as a male prostitute,
they for some reason treat as unspeakable his time as a critical theorist.147
The implication of this foreclosure is that one cannot both be a martyr (as
the hagiographies assume Achmat is) and oﬀer a critical theory of martyr-
dom (as Achmat has done in his writing), as if the aura and authenticity of
political sacriﬁce would be somehow conjured away by explicit account of
the mechanisms by which such eﬀects are produced.
   In an odd way, this implication is entirely consistent with the arguments
of the refused texts themselves. In his 1994 ‘‘Oﬀ the Control Track: Power,
Resistance, and Representation in South African Documentaries,’’ Achmat
oﬀers ‘‘a theorization and critique of ideas which invoke suﬀering, sacriﬁce,
and death as necessary for liberation.’’ 148 He focuses, in particular, on the
matrices of power and knowledge that, prior to any pure source of popular
memory, make possible the documentary ﬁlmic narration of the antiapart-
heid struggle as an ‘‘unarmed people prepared to confront the mightiest
military force on the African continent with the power of their own death.’’ 149
His critique of this matrix is that, by conﬁguring death as sacriﬁce, it recu-
perates from death a surplus value, in the form of the signiﬁer of the martyr,
that documentary ﬁlm essentially enjoys and exploits. The immanent power
of these signiﬁers, Achmat suggests, is their capacity to haunt—to ‘‘possess’’
the subject that witnesses them.150
   At the close of Achmat’s essay—which, like his 1995 ‘‘My Childhood as an
Adult Molester,’’ ends with an explicit emphasis on beginning 151—his text
takes a metacritical turn. As if the essay had been directed, all along, against
the Greco-Roman-Christian metaphysic that translates martyrdom into
witnessing, substitutes testimony for witnessing, and derives protest from
testimony, Achmat’s critique of the content of anti-apartheid documen-
taries enters into a retheorization of the way that martyrdom is inscribed in
the testamentary form of protest documentary itself. Acknowledging that
the ‘‘mimetic approximation to truth’’ that deﬁnes the documentary form
is ‘‘derived from the experience of suﬀering, repression, and death,’’ Ach-
mat suggests that this mimeticism is itself generative of the sacriﬁcial cycle
of violence it claims merely to represent. The documentary emphasis on
martyrdom, he argues, ‘‘may in fact be the constant reinvention of the origi-
nary trauma of colonial wars and conquest, racial domination, gender and
class inequalities, projected onto martyred bodies.’’ 152 Quite unlike René
792 Adam Sitze



Girard, from whose analytic of mimeticism Achmat maintains a studied
distance, Achmat argues that insofar as documentary ﬁlm derives its power
of truth from what he calls ‘‘the power of one’s own death,’’ the correlation
of attestation and conscience that deﬁnes its mode of truth production will
necessarily require death, in the form of the reproduction of the martyrs
on whose behalf it then claims to bear witness. Achmat suggests that this
derivation of truth and politics from death becomes especially intolerable,
under conditions where imperialist fantasies of African nihilism ﬁnd their
rhyme in the African state’s exercise of a certain denialism.
     Living in Africa on a continent which signiﬁes death and destruction
     in the imperialist imaginary, it is imperative to uncouple sacriﬁce from
     resistance. Faced with the denial of state responsibility for the basic
     conditions of life in villages, towns, and cities across the continent we
     cannot indulge the genocidal fantasies of sacriﬁce. Hence, it is disturb-
     ing to read ﬁlmmakers who insist upon valorising sacriﬁce and torture
     as a necessity for the pastoral reinvention of Africa.153
To oppose the pleasure principle inscribed in documentary attestation, Ach-
mat turns to Foucault’s argument, in the ﬁnal chapter of the ﬁrst volume
of The History of Sexuality, that ‘‘death is power’s limit.’’ His reading of Fou-
cault is precise and subtle, and I would like to read over Achmat’s shoulder
in order to draw out what I feel are its implications. In the chapter to which
Achmat turns, Foucault begins by discussing ‘‘patria potestas.’’ 154 Without
going any further, it is already worth noting that, in the political philoso-
phies of Kant and Hegel, the notion of ‘‘testament’’ receives its intelligibility
from the same Roman laws of patriarchal inheritance that give rise to the
modern concept of state sovereignty.155 The codes of patria potestas that give
the father the right to decide on the life or death of the son also stipulate the
conditions under which the will of the father can survive his death. Testa-
ments are designed to guarantee primogeniture (the institution so opposed
by the early Marx): the testis in testament presupposes the testes of the patria
potestas.
   The stakes of Achmat’s critique of documentary attestation become
clearer once read alongside Foucault’s inquiry into the limits of patria po-
testas. His critique becomes intelligible as a challenge to documentary ﬁlm
to think beyond its capitulation to the nihilism inscribed in the patriarchal
concept of testament. To frame images of death as signiﬁers of martyrdom
is not only to locate the truth, test, or touchstone of political struggle in
                                                                     Denialism   793



death. It is also to come into possession of the images of the dead as if they
were nothing more than properties invested with a certain political value—
as if the dead have merely left behind their images in a last will and tes-
tament the validity of which it then falls to documentary ﬁlm to execute
as a kind of ‘‘estate.’’ But by placing this kind of value on death, Achmat
seems to argue, documentary ﬁlm also unwittingly turns death itself into a
value. It exorcises the power immanent to the images of the dead (the power
to possess the living) even as it teaches the unhaunted living to value life
as nothing more than a potential political death. Documentary ﬁlm would
thus remain under the sway of patria potestas to the extent that its ethics of
attestation derives its understanding of death from a property-based notion
of inheritance. Resistance to patria potestas would, in turn, require a depar-
ture from documentary ﬁlm’s capitulation to and recapitulation of the tes-
tamentary poetics grounded in this understanding.
   Why else might Achmat be reading The History of Sexuality in 1994—a
moment of political transition that also marked a juncture where confes-
sion and testimony were becoming the dominant regimes of intelligibility
for the narration of apartheid. Whether in the managed spectacles of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission or in the spate of biographies and
autobiographies that emerged in the 1990s, discourses on the transition
from apartheid became governed by the regime of truth Foucault has called
exomologesis. Though exomologesis can be roughly translated as ‘‘recognition
of fact,’’ Foucault treats it as a ‘‘technology of the self ’’ designed to purify the
soul from sin through a self-revelation (publicatio sui) that is simultaneously
a self-renunciation (the extreme form of which is martyrdom). Like any
technology of the self, exomologesis is a distinctly collective act; whether in
its medical or juridical form, it unfolds as a dramatic ritual of penitence that
reconcites the penitent with the community and the community to itself.
Foucault’s inquiry into exomologesis, which advances his discussion of con-
fession in the ﬁrst volume of The History of Sexuality, approaches it as a spe-
ciﬁcally pastoral power, a mode of subjectivation that binds the subject to
itself through various practices of self-knowledge: publicly disclosing one’s
wounds in order to be cured; bearing witness against and refusing oneself
in order to make a break with one’s past; and reaﬃrming the fact of one’s
ﬁdelity to the principle of salvation through truth.156
   Returning to Foucault’s comments on exomologesis helps us reread the
opening of Achmat’s 1995 ‘‘My Childhood as an Adult Molester,’’ which ren-
ders testimony decidedly indistinct from the most uncensored fantasy.157
794 Adam Sitze



This preference not to deliver straight testimony marks a departure from
the disciplines of self-revelation that otherwise dominated the production
of discourse about apartheid in the mid-1990s. Achmat instead locates the
truth of politics, and the politics of truth, in a joyful militancy that aﬃrms
even death itself—though in a very cautious way. Reading Foucault’s re-
marks on the nature of contemporary sovereign power, Achmat suggests
that while ‘‘death is the limit of power, sacriﬁce brings a diﬀerent power
relation to bear on the symbolism of death. The private moments of death
become timeless public images of sacriﬁce.’’ Against exomologesis’s relent-
less imperative to confess and testify publicly, Achmat concludes his essay
by calling for forms of documentary ﬁlm that ‘‘ensure that death once again
becomes the limit point of power and an eternal moment of privacy.’’ This
may seem like an odd point with which to conclude an ending that is sup-
posed to double as a beginning. But read alongside Foucault’s argument
in The History of Sexuality, the aﬃrmative kernel encrypted in it becomes
clearer. If we keep in mind that, for Foucault, death is the limit not to power
per se, but the limit to political sovereignty vested with a power ‘‘to make live
or to cast out into death,’’ we can follow the way in which Achmat’s aﬃrma-
tion of a private death is a line of ﬂight from the sovereign power to decide
life and death.
   This becomes vitally important when we consider the 1999 utterance
that, in its various iterations over the last four years, has become globally
known as Achmat’s ‘‘pledge.’’ ‘‘I will not take expensive treatment until all
ordinary South Africans can get it on the public-health system. That prob-
ably means that I will die a horrible death, even though medical science
has made it unnecessary.’’ 158 As we know, the force of Achmat’s performa-
tive culminated felicitously in his ingestion of ARVs in early August 2003,
days after the Mbeki administration caved to the TAC and announced that
the government would soon roll out a universal AIDS plan. But in making
and keeping his pledge even though—especially while—his life hung in
the balance, didn’t Achmat contradict everything he wrote in 1994? As his
own life and possible death became the object of numerous documentaries,
didn’t he surrender to the very metaphysic of martyrdom, protest, and tes-
timony against which he earlier wrote so passionately? Didn’t Achmat’s
refusal to take ARVs require him to subject himself to the very sovereign
power against which he protested, namely, the power to let die?
   The hagiographies imply exactly this. But to read Achmat’s 1994 and 1995
texts is to gain a new angle from which to understand his pledge. The latter,
                                                                   Denialism   795



like the former, consists of a departure from the entire catalog of transcen-
dental and essentially nihilistic powers collected under the rubric of patria
potestas. Up to and including martyrdom. Though Achmat made a pledge
referring to the possibility of his own death, it would be a mistake to pre-
sume this pledge expresses a desire to protest or bear witness through or to
the ‘‘power of one’s own death.’’ Recalling that Achmat is a dedicated reader
of Bataille, and a writer for whom life, sex, and politics are inextricable, let
me conclude by dwelling on the singular politics of his pledge. To do so
is to wonder whether, prior to its utterance, perhaps even as its condition
of possibility and as the source of its power, it was subtended by a secret,
cautious pact with the virus itself. A pact of what kind? In 1993, Alexan-
der García Düttmann argued that the anxiety of living with HIV/AIDS is,
in part, that the virus undermines the ontological distinction between life
and death. ‘‘One no longer lives and has not yet died, because one has died
already and nevertheless lives on, because life and death merge beyond rec-
ognition.’’ 159 Under political conditions where death marks power’s limit,
wouldn’t this indistinction amount to an edge? Wouldn’t it yield a power
to protest sovereign power from just beyond, or just before, the limit that
deﬁnes its jurisdiction? Supposing it were even possible for a virus to sign a
pact, that is to say, to keep its promise, wouldn’t one of the eﬀects of that pact
be a chance to take part in a combat against sovereign power without also
having anything to do with the limits it inscribes in life? Signing a secret
pact with the virus would not here be a matter of using the ‘‘power of one’s
own death’’ as an instrument of political leverage. It would be a matter of
cautiously opening a relation to death that nevertheless did not derive its
political power from death. Part of the power of such a pact would derive
from giving oneself over to the virus, surrendering to its replication, but on
one critical condition: that one gain from that replication a new power. This
power would be neither a power of one’s own death nor a power to repre-
sent death. It would instead be a paradoxical power that derives its speciﬁc
modality from the ontological indeterminacy of the virus itself: from a virus
that is neither dead nor alive, the power to live without dying on the terms
of sovereign power.
   Pledging to remain without ARVs until the poorest have access to them
would then be a way of introducing a promise, and therefore the political
itself, into the relations between people living with HIV but without ARVs.
Letting his body embody a wrong that itself calls for justice would be a way
of aﬃrming the same HIV-positive political community his pledge posits.
796 Adam Sitze



Putting his life on the line would be neither stoicism nor satyagraha,160 but
a way of drawing on the virus to redeﬁne the line between life and death
itself: to re-create the diagnosis ‘‘positive’’ in and as a name for the aﬃrma-
tion of life with HIV. The pledge would not, then, be a pact of the sort that
binds one to oneself in solipsistic moral consistency (promise-keeping).161
It would be a process of individuation deﬁned by a protest of the condition
of the dead and the living dead.162 To iterate the virus’s own potency in and
as the power of that pledge would be to transcribe the very power of the
virus into a power of truth the most powerful eﬀect of which—treatment—
would amount to the virus’s recession. It would be to enter into a cautious
ensemble with the virus that was at the same time a combat against it. It
would be to turn the virus back on itself, to make it work on itself, to turn
the virus’s own power into a potential for the virus to be maintained in pri-
vation—to live, with it.
    Who knows whether this pact, in fact, exists. Perhaps I have just imagined
it. But what is clear enough is that, grasped hagiographically, the truth-force
of Achmat’s pledge cannot but be misrecognized as the martyrdom from
which Achmat, in 1994, urged ﬂight. On these terms, it would remain intel-
ligible merely as a particularly bold and forcefully instrumentalist form of
dissent, objection, or complaint. But other visions of protest are possible.
From Zackie Achmat one can learn that protest also signiﬁes promise and
aﬃrmation, and that to protest and to live are undeniably the same.

34 This is not to suggest, however, that an advanced health infrastructure is necessary
    before ARVs can begin to be administered successfully. On the contrary, recent studies
    have shown that the poors in Cape Town adhere more strictly to prescribed ARV regi-
    mens than do people in the United Kingdom, thus putting the lie to the argument that
    ‘‘poor Africans, many of whom lack watches and literacy, would break the strict regime
    of taking certain pills at certain times, risking the emergence of a drug-resistant strain
    of HIV’’ (Rory Carroll, ‘‘Aids Orphans’ Survival Oﬀers Africa Hope; Ground-Breaking
    Treatment Debunks Drug Firm Myths in Cape Town,’’ The Observer, May 25, 2003, 19;

   point of ‘‘surplus populations,’’ the predominantly anthropological and phenomenologi-
   cal terms of Mbembe’s analysis of violence lead his discussion of generalized sovereignty
   astray. In the case of HIV/AIDS, generalized sovereignty’s ‘‘destruction of human bodies
   and populations’’ is not, as Mbembe suggests, linked to ‘‘the generalized instrumental-
   ization of human existence’’ (‘‘Necropolitics,’’ 13). On the contrary, the people abandoned
   by capital’s replication of surplus value are not instrumentalized at all, which is why
   capital abandons them. The violence of this abandonment is neither phenomenological
   nor anthropological but immanent to the circuits of capital itself.
38 This estimate is based on a study that is, in turn, the ‘‘result of a hypothetical model of
   the costs of a package of care likely to be received by those people with HIV or AIDS
   who gain access to health care services. This excludes the very signiﬁcant proportion of
   people who, we believe, will not gain access to health services at all’’ (65). See ‘‘AIDS in

   of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, no. 23, September 1991, 69).

40 Sholto Cross, ‘‘A Socio-Economic Analysis of the Long-Run Eﬀects of AIDS in South
   Africa,’’ in Cross and Whiteside, Facing Up to AIDS, 139. Cross goes on to argue that ‘‘in
   the South African case, there is very strong evidence for the neo-Malthusian position:
   obscured as the situation has been by the social engineering policies of apartheid, never-
   theless the intrinsically low levels of employment and the high reproduction rates—
   in association with a primary-resource based economy with no obvious possibilities
   for rural involution—mean that there is a strong correlation between high population
   growth rates and the entrapment in poverty of the majority. To the extent that AIDS will
   bring about an overall reduction in population growth rates, there is thus a prima facie
   case that the eﬀect on economic growth—and of course on per capita income, although
   this in itself is no very satisfactory indicator—will from one point of view be positive’’
   (140–41).

52 The concept of the commons has become one of the key grounds for altermondialiste
    struggle, up to and including the struggle for treatment access. Thus, of the various
    groups engaged in such struggles, Naomi Klein could argue, ‘‘the spirit they share is
    a radical reclaiming of the commons’’ (‘‘Reclaiming the Commons,’’ New Left Review
    9 [May–June 2001]: 82; compare Alternatives to Economic Globalization: A Better World
    Is Possible; A Report of the International Forum on Globalization [San Francisco: Berrett-
    Koehler, 2002], 79–104, esp. 86). But as compelling and correct as this characterization
    may be, the commons is often narrated in the genre of a kind of pastoral heterotopia,
    implying that models for late modern global anticapitalism can be derived from ante-
    capitalist Europe. The problem with this is not only its nostalgia, but also the relation
    of its rhetoric of crisis to the Malthusian problématique that has governed some of the
    more prominent late modern returns to the notion of the commons. That the latter is
    also a response to the ‘‘problem of overpopulation’’ is evident from Garrett Hardin’s ‘‘The
    Tragedy of the Commons,’’ which concludes by arguing that ‘‘it is the role of education
    to reveal to all the necessity of abandoning the freedom to breed. Only so, can we put
    an end to this [populational] aspect of the tragedy of the commons’’ (Science 162 [1968]:
    1248). It remains an open question whether Negri’s theorization of the ‘‘immeasurable
    opening’’ of the common, which tacitly cites Rancière’s rereading of Plato, departs from
    this problématique (Time for Revolution, trans. Mateo Mandarini [New York: Continuum
    Books, 2003], 181–93).

     donation’’ (Robert Weissman and Zackie Achmat, ‘‘Defying the Drug Cartel: The South
     African Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines,’’ Multinational Monitor [January–
     February 2001]: 32). Similarly, a one-billion-dollar loan announced by Clinton in 2000
     carried ‘‘the condition that the drugs must be bought from American pharmaceutical
     ﬁrms’’ (Cheru, ‘‘Debt Relief and Social Investment,’’ 527; Gellman ‘‘Unequal Calculus’’;
     Gellman, ‘‘World Shunned Signs’’). None of this, of course, prevented capital from pat-
     ting itself on the back for a job well done. See Michael Waldholz, ‘‘AZT Price Cut for Third

 75   The United States’ aggressive assertion of patent rights, even in cases where its own
      national security interests seem to dictate otherwise (witness the debates around Cipro
      in October 2001), has ultimately undermined even the hegemony of its own institu-
      tions of neoliberal economics. The attempts by the United States in December 2002 and
      August 2003 to dilute paragraph 6 of the WTO’s November 2001 Doha Ministerial Decla-
      ration heralded, if not also concretely prepared the way for, the collapse of the WTO trade
      talks in Cancun in September 2003. See ‘‘The Right Fix?’’ The Economist, August 28,
      2003, 1. The United States’ assertion of such rights is not, of course, a new development.

84 At the time, a generic version of Fluconazole cost US$0.30 in Thailand; under patent
   in South Africa and Kenya, the same medicine cost US$15.00 and US$18.00, respec-
   tively (Poku, ‘‘Africa’s AIDS Crisis,’’ 202; Médecins Sans Frontières, ‘‘Untangling the

   Countries’’ [July 1, 2002], www.accessmed-msf.org/documents/purple2.pdf [accessed
   April 4, 2004]). In March 2000, the TAC challenged Pﬁzer to reduce the price of Flu-
   conazole to US$0.50 per 200 milligram. In the same month, Cipla oﬀered Nevirapine
   for 135 rupees per tab, more than half Boehringer Ingelheim’s price of 344 rupees for the
   ‘‘brand-name’’ version of the same. In October 2000, the TAC announced the Christo-
   pher Moraka Deﬁance Campaign against patent abuse, and began illegally importing
   Fluconazole from Thailand. In January 2001, the ﬁrst illegal shipment of Fluconazole
   arrived.
85 It was not until 1999 that the World Bank could bring itself to publicly articulate this
   consensus: ‘‘Nowhere is the eﬀort big enough, or well-resourced enough to turn the epi-
   demic back’’ (World Bank, Intensifying Action against HIV/AIDS in Africa, Responding
   to a Development Crisis, (Washington, DC: The International Bank for Reconstruction
   and Development, Africa Region, 1999). The latest eﬀorts remain governed by the same
   consensus. Even though 6 million people with AIDS will be in immediate clinical need
   of ARVs by 2005, and 11.5 million by 2008, the WHO’s goal is to treat only 3 million by
   2005, and PEPFAR’s only 2 million by 2008.The massively underfunded GFATM, mean-
   while, is at this point capable of providing ARVs to only 491,000 people with HIV/AIDS
   by 2008 (HealthGAP, ‘‘Treat the People—Commit to Treat Those in Immediate Clinical
   Need,’’ [May 13, 2003], on ﬁle with author).

89 Writing in 1961, seven years after Lacan used refus as one of two terms to translate

91 See Culhane, ‘‘Recurring Nightmare,’’ 386. The ACT UP slogan ‘‘SILENCE = DEATH’’
   was aimed, in large part, at Reagan, who did not even utter the word AIDS until May 31,
   1987—six years after the emergence of HIV in the United States. The murderous homo-
806 Adam Sitze



      phobia of this silence must not be forgotten. The assumption of early epidemiologists
      was that AIDS would be limited to gay communities and drug users, and that after ‘‘satu-
      rating’’ these populations, it would soon ‘‘run out of victims’’ or ‘‘run its course.’’ The
      same epidemiologists wondered aloud whether Africans did not already somehow pos-
      sess a natural immunity to the virus. See F. P. Siegal and M. Siegal, AIDS: The Medical
      Mystery (New York: Grove Press, 1983), 121–24.
92    Nana Poku argues that ‘‘with the exception of Uganda and Senegal, African leaders are
      engaged in denial, typically asserting that the moral values of their societies would not
      permit transmission of an agent such as HIV that is associated with risky sexual behav-
      iour, homosexuality, and injecting drug use’’ (‘‘Africa’s AIDS Crisis in Context,’’ 199).
      Amson Sibanda has likewise noted ‘‘ignorance and denial’’ as factors for the spread of
      HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe (‘‘A Nation in Pain: Why the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Is Out of
      Control in Zimbabwe,’’ International Journal of Health Services 30.4 [2000]: 730, 735).
      Carolyn Baylies concurs, noting that instead of intervening in the pandemic, African
      governments have responded with a ‘‘stance of denial, or, alternately, oﬃcial acknowl-
      edgement of the need for an AIDS policy coupled with a persistent failure to accept the
      depth of the crisis of the urgency of the situation, much less to follow through on the
      construction of a comprehensive policy’’ (Baylies, ‘‘Overview: HIV/AIDS in Africa,’’ 488,
      491; but compare Cheru, ‘‘Debt Relief and Social Investment,’’ 526).

94    I take it as axiomatic that, since the days of the Dutch East Indies Company, if not earlier,
      corporations have arrogated to themselves the prerogatives of sovereignty (territorial
      control, monopoly over legitimate violence, right to decide life and death, police power
      in the broadest sense, etc.) and that the Kantian distinction between a land’s ‘‘supreme
      owner’’ (Obereigentümer) and its ‘‘supreme commander’’ (Oberbefehlshaber) is no longer
      helpful, if it ever was, for grasping manifestations of sovereign power. Instead, as Agam-
      ben argues, sovereignty can no longer be understood as an ‘‘exclusively political concept,
      an exclusively juridical category, a power external to law, or the supreme rule of the
      juridical order’’ (Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer I: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans.

96    It is important to note that whereas Article 31 of TRIPs by no means requires a decla-
      ration of health emergency to invoke compulsory licensing, it permits certain limita-
      tions on compulsory licensing to be waived in the case of such a declaration, and so
                                                                               Denialism     807



      places considerable powers at the disposal of governments, at the same time it raises
      the stakes on the exercise of those powers. In eﬀect, the sovereign exception is the only
      form of political power TRIPs permits states to exercise over licensing questions. See
      Ford, ‘‘Compulsory Licensing Provisions,’’ 959.
97    In October 1999, Mbeki made his denialism public in a speech before the National
      Council of Provinces. In May 2000, he convened an HIV/AIDS ‘‘advisory panel’’ com-
      posed of denialists. In July 2000, Mbeki delivered the opening address to the Thirteenth
      International AIDS Conference, in which he declared that he doubted whether every-
      thing could be blamed on a single virus. In September 2000, Mbeki oﬀered denialist
      remarks in Time magazine, and Minister of Health Tshabalala-Msimang oﬀered similar
      remarks on South African radio. See Mbali, ‘‘HIV/AIDS Policy-Making,’’ 319–20.
98    Of ‘‘Castro Hlongwane,’’ Achmat said, ‘‘On the record, you had, for the ﬁrst time, an
      indication of the madness, the irrationality, the blindness, the willfulness, the vindic-
      tiveness of Mbeki on this question’’ (quoted in Samantha Powers, ‘‘The AIDS Rebel,’’
      The New Yorker, May 19, 2003, 65). Compare also Pieter-Dirk Uys ‘‘‘AIDS Comes from
      Venus; HIV Comes from Mars!’’’ Index on Censorship 4 (2001): 21–22; Newaal Deane,

99    ‘‘This monograph accepts that our people, and others elsewhere in Africa and the rest of
      the world, face a serious problem of AIDS. It accepts the determination that AIDS stands
      for Acquired Immunodeﬁciency Syndrome. It accepts that a Syndrome is a collection
      of diseases. It proceeds from the assumption that the collection of diseases generally
      described as belonging to the AIDS syndrome have known causes. It rejects as illogical
      the proposition that AIDS is a single disease caused by a singular virus, HIV. In other
      words, it accepts that AIDS is either a syndrome or a disease. It cannot be both. Its acro-
      nym correctly describes it as a syndrome. For this reason, it is not described as AIDD. It
      accepts that an essential part of AIDS is immune deﬁciency. This constitutes the ID in
      AIDS. It accepts that this immune deﬁciency may be acquired, accounting for the A in
      AIDS. It asserts that there are many conditions that cause acquired immune deﬁciency,
      including malnutrition and disease. . . . It accepts that HIV may be one of the causes of
      this immune deﬁciency, but cannot be the only cause’’ (4).
100   ‘‘Bernstein makes the important observation that ‘[AIDS is] the ﬁrst disease that no one
      can survive by deﬁnition. Not only is this description of AIDS logically bankrupt, it sends
      the demoralising and inaccurate message to people with HIV or AIDS that they have a
      disease that is not worth ﬁghting. A more legitimate, and more hopeful, deﬁnition must
      be devised.’ Because of all this, it has become imperative for us to know as precisely as
      possible what our people are dying from, speciﬁcally. To say that our people are dying of
      AIDS will not help us in our struggle to improve the health of our people. As Bernstein
      says, to say this would be to say our people have a disease that is not worth ﬁghting. This
      would certainly condemn them to premature death. It is this that would constitute geno-
      cide’’ (58; emphasis in original). In a similar vein, Mokaba argued that ‘‘we cannot allow
      our people to take something [i.e., ARV therapy] so dangerous that it will actually exter-
      minate them. However well meaning, the hazards of misplaced compassion could lead
      to genocide’’ (quoted in Peter Kwan, ‘‘Biography of a Nightmare: HIV/AIDS in South
      Africa,’’ The John Marshall Law Review 35 [2002]: 394).

       directed the Department of Health in August 2003 to develop an operational plan within
       one month to provide ARVs in the public sector, after Mbeki’s announcement in Novem-
       ber 2003 that his administration would triple its AIDS budget to $1.7 billion, or after the
       TAC’s pressure in South Africa’s Competition Commission forced GlaxoSmithKline and
       Boehringer Ingelheim, in a controversial December 2003 settlement, to issue licenses
       on AZT and Lamivudine to four generic producers. See Sharon LaFraniere, ‘‘South

126    It is hard to know what constitutional provisions could be deployed against this non-
       application of sovereign power: even though Section 37(3) of the 1996 Constitution gives
       the judiciary the power to limit executive declarations of states of emergency, no clauses
       provide powers that would enable the judiciary to require the executive to declare a health
       emergency. The TAC’s MTCT case was, in a way, designed to force Mbeki’s hand on this
       question. MTCT is more readily conceptualized as a ‘‘health emergency’’ than ‘‘mere’’
       seropositivity, which in a certain strict sense is classiﬁed ‘‘only’’ as a ‘‘chronic condition.’’

       Perspectives on South Africa’s Basic Law, ed. P. Andrews and S. Ellmann (Johannesburg:
       Witwatersrand University Press, 2001), 460. There is also a sense in which the TAC’s
       implicitly pronatal legal strategy played into the biopolitical reduction of women to and
       as reproductive organs, while at the same time embracing the tropes of innocence that
       become available once one advocates on behalf of infants. As Heinz Klug’s reading of
       the case suggests, the limit of this strategy was apparent in the discourse of the ruling
       itself (‘‘How Relevant Is the South African Constitution?’’ 817).

 132 Writing in 1992, Alan Fleming argues that one of the unique features of the HIV/AIDS
     pandemic in South Africa is precisely this foreknowledge: ‘‘East and central African
     countries had no warning, as the epidemic was mature and seroprevalence already high
     when serological tests were ﬁrst introduced in 1985, whereas South Africa had the warn-
     ing seven years ago when seroprevalence was still extremely low but the spread south-
     ward of HIV-1 was inevitable’’ (‘‘South Africa and AIDS—Seven Years Wasted,’’ Current

     locations where they serve almost exclusively the white population, and only now [1992]

      testimony and protest, mourning and mobilizing, merge to the point of indistinction.

First, ensure you have both wmctrl and xdotool installed. If not, you can install them using the following commands:<code>
sudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool
</code>
Next, open a new xfce4-terminal instance with the desired dimensions (80% width and full height):
<code>xfce4-terminal --geometry=80x100%</code>

Now, use wmctrl to move the terminal window to the left side of the screen:
wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,-1,-1

The -e option specifies the geometry of the window.
The 0,0 coordinates place the window at the top-left corner.
The -1,-1 values indicate that the window should occupy the full height and width.
Finally, use xdotool to resize the terminal window to 20% of the display width:
xdotool getactivewindow windowsize 3840 100%

Replace 3840 with your actual screen width (in pixels).
Now your xfce4-terminal window should be positioned on the left side of the screen, taking up 20% of the display width. Adjust the screen width value as needed for your specific setup.

Feel free to customize the dimensions and commands according to your preferences! ðŸŒŸ

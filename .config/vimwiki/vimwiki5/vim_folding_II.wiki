You can definitely leverage Vim's folding feature to manage large YAD scripts more efficiently without breaking them into multiple files. This allows you to collapse and expand sections of your script, making it easier to navigate and debug while still keeping everything in one place.
Steps to Use Folding in Vim:

    Enable Manual Folding in Vim:
        Open your YAD script in Vim and enable manual folding:

        bash

    :set foldmethod=manual

Create Folds Around Sections:

    You can mark sections of your YAD script for each tab and fold them using the following key commands:
        Move to the start of a section (e.g., the first line of a tab):

        bash

    zf10j

    This folds the next 10 lines. You can adjust the number based on the length of the section.

Alternatively, to manually define folds:

bash

    zf/END_OF_TAB_1

    This will fold everything from the current cursor position until the specified pattern.

Example Script with Folding:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# YAD Main Notebook
yad --notebook --key=12345 --width=1400 --height=600 --grid-lines="BOTH" \
    --title="Your Friendly AI 2.0" --center --text="A little something..." \
    --borders=20 --image-on-top --image="/home/batan/10/postinstall/yad.png" &

# {{{ Tab 1 - Podcast
yad --plug=12345 --tabnum=1 --text="LC-Linux Podcast and Audio-Process App" \
    --borders=20 --form --field="Update Podcast Episodes":FBTN \
    "sudo -u batan bash $mash_dir/lc-get-podcasts" &> res1 &
# }}}

# {{{ Tab 2 - Text to Speech
yad --plug=12345 --tabnum=2 --text="Text to Speech" --borders=30 \
    --image-on-top --image="/home/batan/100/icons/tts1.png" --title="TTS" &
# }}}

Folding Commands:

    To toggle fold open or closed:

    bash

za

To open all folds:

bash

zR

To close all folds:

bash

    zM

Make Folds Persistent:

    If you want Vim to remember the folds when you reopen the file, add the following to your .vimrc:

    bash

    set foldmethod=marker
    set foldlevel=0
    set foldenable

Folding by Syntax (Alternative): If you'd prefer to fold your script by syntax (e.g., based on { and } or function definitions), you can use:

bash

    :set foldmethod=syntax

Benefits of Folding:

    Cleaner Overview: You can collapse sections (e.g., tabs) that you're not working on, reducing visual clutter.
    Faster Navigation: Focus only on the active part of the script while keeping the rest hidden.
    Efficient Debugging: Temporarily hide stable parts of your script to concentrate on the problematic sections.

By using Vimâ€™s folding, you can modularize and simplify your large YAD script within a single file, avoiding the overhead of managing multiple scripts but still gaining the ability to focus and debug more effectively.

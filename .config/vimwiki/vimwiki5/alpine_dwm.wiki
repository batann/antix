= DWM_on_ALPINE =

== Prerequisites ==

     * Install AlpineLinux
     * Create a user account (optional but recommended)
     * Enable the Community repository
     * Install Xorg

== Installing from binary repository ==

   # apk add dwm dmenu st

   This will install st

== Installing from source ==

== Installing dependencies ==

   Note: git make gcc g++ libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev ncurses are needed to install suckless tools from
   source.

   dbus-x11 is needed for the dbus system (enables firefox running in dwm to open in a tile)
   The last three adwaita-gtk2-theme adwaita-icon-theme font-dejavu are optional, but recommended for a nicer
   looking firefox.

   The command to install the dependencies:

   # apk add ncurses
   libxft-dev

== Installing suckless tools dwm, dmenu, and st from source ==

   Change to the /tmp directory.

   $ cd /tmp

   then execute:

   # git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm

   Once downloaded, go to the dwm directory

   # cd dwm

   To install, run:

   # make clean install

   Next, go up one directory level

   # cd ..

   to install dmenu:

   # git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu # cd dmenu # make clean install

   Finally, go up one more directory level

   # cd ..

   to install st:

   # git clone https://git.suckless.org/st # cd st # make clean install

== Setting up your profile ==

   Change to your home directory:

   $ cd ~

   Create or edit .xinitrc with at least the following:

   Contents of ~/.xinitrc
   exec dwm

   Save the file and exit vi.

   Next, create or edit .profile with at least the following:

   Contents of ~/.profile
   startx
   Note: If you install additional programs that call your `$SHELL` with the POSIX `-l` login flag, you'll need
   to make launching `startx` conditional, otherwise X will attempt to launch every time your shell is called
   with the login flag.

   Contents of ~/.profile
   if ; then startx fi

   Log out or reboot. dwm will run the next time you log in. Press Alt+p to launch dmenu. Type firefox then press
   enter. Firefox will load and run in tile 9.
